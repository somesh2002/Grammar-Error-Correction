Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing in order to express my disappointment about your musical show " Over the Rainbow " .
I saws the show 's advertisement hanging up of a wall in London where I was spending my holiday with some friends . I convinced them to go there with me because I had heard good references about your Company and , above all , about the main star , Danny Brook .
The problems started in the box office , where we asked for the discounts you announced in the advertisement , and the man who was selling the tickets said that they did n't exist .
Moreover , the show was delayed forty - five minutes and the worst of all was that Danny Brook had been replaced by another actor .
On the other hand , the theatre restaurant was closed because unknown reasons .
You promised a perfect evening but it became a big disastrous !
I would like some kind of explanation and receive my money back .
If you do n't agree , I will act consequently .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Last Wednesday Carole received a letter .
The stamp was from a foreign country and the address was written in Capital Letters .
She did n't recognize the writing .
She began to read " Dear Carolin ..
There was only a person who used to call her by this name .
It brought a lot of memories back to her .
It was long time ago , when she was fourteen and Paul sixteen .
He was her first love and also the first who kissed her .
Paul had to move to Mexico because of his father 's work .
When they were saying goodbye Paul " I will be the last person who will kiss you " . " It sounds nice but I do n't believe it " she replied .
" You only have to wait " he said .
But she did n't wait .
She got married and had two children .
At this moment Carole was living with her husband but they did n't love each other any more .
Their love had finished .
In his letter Paul said that he had become a rich man and he would come back to meet her again .
Her friend Pat had explained the whole story at her husband .
What she would do ?

Dear Manager ,
I would like to complain about your theatre and the musical show that I saw last week .
I went to London for a holiday last week and read the advertisement about ' Over the rainbow ' in the hotel which I stayed .
I saw Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were written on the advertisement paper and was very excited .
However , Danny Brook did not appear on the stage until the end of musical showing time .
I was really disappointed about it .
Secondly , starting time was 19:30 but it started 20:15 so I was waited for 45 minutes .
It was so long time to wait in the theatre .
Thirdly , it mentioned about discounts .
Despite of the fact that I am a student , I could not get any discounts .
I also visited your restaurant after the show but already closed because the show finished late .
Because of the reason above , I , indeed , spent awful last night in London .
I would like you to refund , otherwise , I will take an action .
I look forward to receiving reply to my enquiry .
Sincerely
Fashion of the future
People will wear this kind of clothes 100 years later from now .
If weather is hot then we do n't have to wear under wear because very thin and light clothes will support our bodies .
For example , T - shirts for women are included bra : easy to take it out when you wash it , is very simple and comfortable .
What about short pants ?
You do n't have to wear knickers .
We can just put some thin pads in there .
We ca n't feel it and easy to remove and just can wash it .
Simplest is the best in summer !
When it 's very cold winter , we just wear light clothes what we want , in our style .
Because special warm and healthy material will be developed and use them inside thin clothes so we do n't need to put heavy clothes on our bodies .
We can show our body line in winter as well .
Most important thing is that we do n't have to kill the animals only for people 's cruel aims .

PRINCIPAL MR .
ROBERTSON
DEAR SIR ,
I WANT TO THAK YOU FOR PREPARING SUCH A GOOD PROGRAMME FOR US AND ESPECIALLY FOR TAKING US TO THE RIVER TRIP TO GREENWICH .
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE OF CHANGING THE PROGRAMME BECAUSE WE HAVE FOUND A VERY INTERESTING ACTIVITY TO DO ON TUESDAY 14 MARCH . IT CONSISTS ON VISITING THE LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW IN THE CENTRAL EXHIBITION HALL .
I THINK IT 'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE GREATER USE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE .
ON THE OTHER HAND , WE COULD LEARN THE DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET TO THE CENTRAL EXHIBITION HALL .
I SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD GO TO THE NATIONAL ART GALLERY IN THE MORNING AND INSTEAD OF HAVING THE AFTERNOON FREE WE COULD GO TO THE FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW .
I WILL BE WRITING ANXIOUSLY FOR YOUR RESPONSE .
YOURS FAITHFULLY
( FAMOUS PEOPLE , SUCH AS POLITICIANS AND FILM STARS , DESERVE TO HAVE A PRIVATE LIFE WITHOUT JOURNALISTS FOLLOWING THEM ALL THE TIME )
FAMOUS PEOPLE SUCH AS SINGERS , FILM STARS , ETC ARE ALWAYS THE CENTRE OF ATTENTION .
AS SOME OF THEM ARE CONSIDERED IDOLS , THEIR FANS WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY ACT IN THEIR PRIVATE LIVES , WITH THEIR FAMILY OR FRIENDS .
AS A RESPONSE TO THIS DEMAND OF INFORMATION , JOURNALISTS FOLLOW FAMOUS PEOPLE DAY AND NIGHT IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS , FOR EXAMPLE , CHASING THEIR CARS , TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS OR BREAKING INTO THEIR HOUSES WHILE THEY ARE ON HOLIDAYS .
THIS SITUATION AFFECTS FAMOUS PERSONAL LIVES BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE PRIVACY
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT , ALTHOUGH THEY ARE FAMOUS , THEY ARE JUST NORMAL PEOPLE THAT DESERVE TO HAVE A PRIVATE LIFE WITHOUT JOURNALISTS AND FANS FOLLOWING THEM ALL THE TIME , AND ON THE OTHER HAND PEOPLE HAVE TO LEARN TO RESPECT THE FAMOUS RIGHT TO KEEP THEIR PERSONAL LIVES IN SECRET .
IN MY OPINION FAMOUS PEOPLE ARE BEING OBLIGED TO PAY A PRICE FOR BEING FAMOUS THAT IN SOME CASS , COSTS MORE THAN THEY DESERVE TO PAY .
To Mr. Robertson
I am writing to tell you something about the three - day trip to London .
I have seen your programme for the trip and I think it is going to be a great trip .
Thank you very much for organising this trip and putting all your spare time and effort into it .
Personally , I enjoy looking and learning about new inventions and all the science .
That is why I think the trip to the science museum is a good idea .
However , my class and I have seen an advertisement about a fashion and leisure show . We are attracted to this show and would like to go .
Unfortunately , it is on 14th March , which is the day we will be visiting the science museum .
This show is on the 14th March .
It is in the Central Exhibition Hall and will start and ten o'clock and finish at five o'clock in the evening .
Apparently , this show is free to all students , which means if we went , the cost of the trip will be cut down .
I think it is a great opportunity because it is based on fashion .
We like to keep up with the rage but I think it will help those who want to become a fashion designer later on .
I have a suggestion on how the programme could be changed .
The shopping time could be after the show and the free time exchanged for the science museum .
If we go to the show , we can do without the free time .
Please give this your careful consideration ..
Yours sincerely ,
In a country like the UK , we are all bound to have houses .
We either own it , or we simply borrow it from other people . We take our homes for granted .
Think about the people in the poor countries !
They struggle to survive .
However , as we approach the future , our homes will start to change .
Have you ever thought about how the changes will affect our lives ?
I doubt it .
There will be lots of differences in our homes of the future from our homes now , but there may also be a lot of similarities .
For one , the future homes might not be built out of bricks at all !
It may be built out of a stronger substance or a more attractive one , such as glass .
Non - breakable glass .
Also , due to global warming , sea levels might rise and risk of flooding will also rise .
Therefore , houses will be built on high supports .
All domestic appliances such as showers , kettles , lights , TV and curtains may be voice activated .
Incredibly high security will prevent robbery .
The future homes will also have many similarities , such as having a separate bathroom , and not having one in a bedroom , or having two floors or having garages .
It has been a pleasure sharing my thoughts with you .
What do you think will happen in the future ?
Dear Mrs. Jane Clark ,
Recently I was at the annual international arts festival , that you organized .
I 'm writing this letter to thank you for giving a possibility to know more about modern art .
I think , it is a wonderful idea to organize such festivals each year , because it is very interesting to learn some news about life in other countries .
Unfortunately , only six countries were represented this year at the festival , but I hope that soon there would be much more of them .
I extremely liked all concerts , shows , exhibitions , but why there were n't any photograph exhibitions ?
I think , you should make some next year .
Then , I want to mark , that concert halls were too small , that is why they were overcrowded during some concerts .
Then , I want to say , that plays and films were exellent , but it was n't enough of them for me .
May be you should make more next year ?
And at the end , my opinion is that one weekend ticket for all events is a great idea , because you do n't have to stay in queues to buy a ticket for a show , you want to go to .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Lucia ,
I was very pleased to receive your letter .
You asked , if there are some school rules in my country .
As you know , I 'm studying at the private Academy , so the rules in my institute are different from the rules in state institutes . I 'll give you an example .
In our Acadamy we are not allowed to smoke .
The fine for smoking on the Academy is territory is 100 dollars .
So nobody smokes there .
I do n't smoke , so I do n't care about this rule .
But some of my friends really would like to change it .
You also wanted to know about what I 'm allowed or not allowed to do at home .
Well , I have rather modern parents , so they do n't prohibit me to go to the discoes or somewhere with my friends .
The only rule for me at home is to walk out with my dog three times a day .
I hope it was interesting for you to know about the rules in my life .
Look forward to hearing from you ,
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I was to Circle Theatre to watch ' Over the rainbow ' musical show , recently .
I was trully dissapointed by it .
My expectations were high after I 've read your leaflet in which it was advertised as ' London 's newest and best musical show ' .
Now , I can assure you it was n't .
Firstly , it was Danny Brook who was supposed to star .
The substitute was far worse .
Secondly , I had to wait fourty - five minutes before the show finally began .
Another unkept promise are the discounts .
There were n't any !
Lastly , when I got hungry after the delay it appeared that the theatre restaurant is closed . You can believe me it was n't ' my perfect evening out ' and I have no other choice than asking to give my money back .
I paid for something I did n't get so it is obvious that I want my money back .
I got the £ 15 ticket .
I 'd like you to send the money to this adress ; ul Taklowa 10

Yours sincerely ,
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
After two days the whole school knew .
When Paul entered the school gate , other children began to tease him and laugh .
Paul could n't stand it .
He ran out quickly , leaving everyone behind .
He felt very ashamed and did n't know what to do .
Normally , he would go and talk to Pat but Pat betrayed him .
They were no longer friends . '
How could he , ' Paul thought ' Now the whole school knows Jean attracts me ' .
As he was sitting there , he heard someone walking towards him .
He turned around and saw ... Jean . '
What are you dong here , why are n't you at school ? '
she asked .
Paul was like paralyzed .
He could n't reply . '
I had heard what you 've said about me ' , she said , I think it 's sweet ' .
Paul could n't believe his ears .
While he was thinking how to reply , Jean took his hand and led him to the school .
When they entered everyone became silent .
All the children were staring at them and Paul thought that Pat is n't that bad at all .

I am glad to know about the news that I have received .
It is a dream becames true and was really unexpected for me !
I would like to travel on July because of it is more suitable for me .
I think I will really enjoy if I could stay in tents it is going to be a new experience and looks exciting .
About the activities while at the Camp I would like to enjoy swimming , not because I am good in it , just because I keen on and the other one is Photography .
As I never did this in whole my life could you tell me if we have to do our own meals or I can find everything ready to eat there ?
If no , what do you sugest ?
The same question for clothes and money .
How much I have to get in my pocket ?
Yours sincerely

Dear friend
Kim
Last month , I enjoyed to help at a pop concert in Portugal .
Everything were new for me .
I had to ( lyd ) tidy up the place where they have to wait until their turn .
The group asked me make sure that in the fridge they always could find a big variety of drinks including honey and lemon for throat .
Other thing I had to do is keep an eye in the towels , I mean , dried towels because as you know that country is too hot , especially for my liking , as they have to change the clothes and looks fresh ; do n't ask me why .
The pop concert happened in a big stadium called " Mararcanã " .
I just did not enjoyed when they were making the instruments work for the big day .
But what I particularly liked was see and ask autographs from the rest of the others groups .
Do n't be jealous , I will make a copy for you , OK ?
Love
Dear Ms Jane Clark .
I am writing to you with regard to the International Art Festival that was held recently .
The festival was excenent in many ways , and especially it being an international festival was a challenging , but brilliant idea .
I assume that this fact attracted people very much .
In addition to that , organising one weekend with special price tickets was particularly good .
I personally think that it helped many people who were not able to afford the tickets with proper price to come to the festival .
Moreover , most of the events I went to were fantastic .
However , I still have some comments to make to improve the festival next year .
The festival was supposed to be an international one , but the artists and stars participated in it were from six countries only .
Thus , I recommend that stars and artists of various nationalities should be invited .
Also , some of the concert halls where the musicians performed were not big enough for the vast number of audiences .
I think it would be much better to use bigger concert halls .
Furthermore , I found that there were not many genres of neither the films nor the plays .
So I suggest you have various kinds , and more numbers of plays and films next year .
I hope that next year 's festival will be much more successful that this year 's one .
Yours sincerely ,
The Old Man and the Sea
People all have different opinions about books .
Some prefer realistic stories whereas others do unusual ones .
But I prefer realistic stories such as Ernest Hemingway 's " The Old Man and the Sea ' .
Above all , realistic stories teach me something of the life , or at least influence me .
As far as I 'm concerned , my behaviour and attitudes towards a difficult situation began to change after reading this book .
Here , the fishman is very old , but he is still challenging to everything he faces .
When he caught a shark which was bigger than the ship , he never gave up taking it back to his village , even when sharks were around him .
Real stories have huge impacts on me , and affect me a lot , often in good ways .
In addition to that , realistic stories are more attractive , I personally do n't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents as I know they can not be true .
But , while reading realistic stories , I just fall deep into the story , into the writer 's own world .
Ernest Hemingway 's sentences are precise , but still very powerful and alive .
So when I read other sharks eating the shark the old man had caught , I got very angry and annoyed .
Realistic stories thus , develop our imagination and creativity , which are essential in our lives .
We all learn from reading books , but realistic stories have more influence on me and develop my personality .
That 's why I prefer realistic stories to unusual ones .
17th June 2000
Dear Sir ,
I would like to complain about a musical show .
I was very disappointing a week holiday for me because I had got a lot of problem with the show .
I had seen the advertisement that the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , but it was not Danny Brook .
I was really disappointing because he is my famous actor .
The musical should started at 19.30 , but it started at 20.15 .
When I went to asked for the discount of ticket in the cashier desk they told me no discount available for this .
I had seen the advertisement say that discount available .
After the show I decide to had dinner in your theatre restaurant , but I could n't because it closed .
It closed at 10 pm but the show finished at 10.30 pm .
This was not perfect evening for me , so if you do n't give my money back , I will tell to the newspaper about it .
I am looking forward to hear a good new .
Yours sincerely ,
Boo Sersuwan .
I think in the next 100 years people will wear the space clothes with small engine in the back . because of the atmosphere .
The atmosphere in the earth now starting badly every years .
The carbon dioxide are growing very fast and people cut more trees , therefore not enough trees to such carbon dioxide and produce oxygen .
The designer will have a lot of idea for how to make very nice and useful clothes .
I think if we wear this clothes we will travel to every where easier than we use cars , ships , planes and space ships .
This mean the engineering will find the way to useless petrol for it , so it must useful in the future .
I think somebody will make a very big area to grow plant because they can sell the oxygen .
This is a new business .
I think I can win this price , because this clothe will produce in the future soon .

mr . MANAGER
MY NAME JAMES CAMIREZ AND I'AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO YOU BECAUSE I HAVE SOME COMPLEINTS FOR THE DISAPPOINTING EVENING I HAD LAST NIGHT .
FIRST OF ALL ON THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE SHOW IT SAYS THAT THE ACTOR WAS GOING TO BE DANNY BROOK AND INSTEAD OF HIM WAS A TOTALLY UNKNOWN CLOWN THAT HAD NO IDEA OF HOW TO ACT , IT WAS HORRIBLY DISAPPOINTING !
SECOND I GOT TO THE THEATRE AT 19.20 BECAUSE IN THE ADVERTISEMENT IT CLEARLY APPEARS THAT THE SHOW STARTS AT 19.30 , AND I GOT HEAVILY MAD WHEN I LOOK MY WATCH AND NOTICE THAT I HAD BEEN WAITING FOR 40 ( FORTY ) MINUTES AND THE SHOW DIDN'T START YET ... I MEAN I WAS AMAIZING !
THEN I READ ON THE ADVERTISEMENT , DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE , AND I DIDN'T GOT ANY DISCOUNTS WHEN I ASKED FOR THEM .
AFTER THE SHOW I GOT OUT THE SHOW ROOM DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED AND WENT TO THE RESTAURANT TO DRINK SOMETHING TO RELAX , AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT ?
.. IT WAS CLOSED !
I COULDN'T BELIVE IT HOW THIS CLASS OF THEATRE CAN BE SO ..
OH I'M GETING MAD AGAIN SO I'AM GOING TO TELL YOU THE LAST THING , IT WAS THE HORRIBLE NIGHT I HAD EVER GOT SO I DEMEND FOR MY MONEY BACK !
I THINK THAT MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS AFFECTED ALL THE HUMAN BEINGS .
MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS AFFECT ME IN SEVERAL WAYS , I MEAN THE MORE THE TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZES ; MORE CONFORTNESSCOMFORTABLE WE GET .
NOW WITH MODERN MACHINES I CAN MAKE A BETTER USE OF MY TIME , IF I'AM LATE TO GO TO TRAINING AND I HADN'T IT YET I JUST TAKE MY FOOD AND PUT IT IN THE MICROWAVEOVEN .
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE COMPUTERS , I THINK THEY ARE ONE OF THE MOST ADVANCED MACHINE IN THE WORLD , YOU CAN LIVE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE IN A HOUSE WITHOUT GOING OUT , BY JUST USING THE INTERNET , IT HAS ALSO HELPED ME IN MY SCHOOL HOMEWORK , I MEAN IT 'S INCREDIBLE THE TIME YOU WAIST BY MAKING THING WITHOUT A COMPUTER .
BUT I THINK ALSO THAT WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY WE GET MORE COMFORTABLE SO THAT MAKES ME A PACIVE PERSON AND NOT SO ACTIVE ,
THIS CAN BE BAD TO BECAUSE IF I GET USED TO BE CONFORTABLE WHEN I NEED TO DO HARD WORKS I WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THEM .

Dear Ms Ryan ,
I am writing to reply your letter and I am so glad to win the prize .
Thank you very much !
In answer your questions : I would like to travel in July .
I am a full - time student , my summer holidays begin at the end of June and I have planned to work on my grandfather 's farm in August .
So July is the only time I will be free .
Secondly , I would prefer tents to log cabins .
Camping is my enthusiasm and I sleep in tents every time I go camping .
Therefore , I am afraid I ca n't get used to log cabins easily .
Besides camping , I also like painting .
My Dad is an amateur painter , and I have begun painting for 8 years .
I 'm good at portraits and landscapes .
I would also like to play golf during my holiday , but I have never played it before , will I get any tuition ?
Finally , I should like to ask some questions .
How is the weather like in California in July ?
What kind of clothes should I pack ?
If I want to buy some gifts , how much money should I take and can I use traveller 's cheques in every place ?
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Shopping is not always enjoyable
Our lives are getting better and better , so people began to go shopping more frequently .
It 's always a great job to go home with bags of purchases , but is it doing us good apart from the temporary satisfaction ?
Everyone likes sale , but those so - called sale items are not really of value .
In fashion industry , sale begins at the end of each season and just lasts a short time , because those owners want to make room for new stock .
But you 'll find your ' cool bargain ' soon get out of date and you have to keep buying new ones .
Also supermarket owners have put in a vast amount of money to find out the best way to place goods in order to get the most profit .
Therefore , we become impulsive buyers easily under these tricks .
The result , we feel guilty after spending more than we 've estimated , or even suffer from financial difficulty .
Shopping does not just effect us mentally , but also physically .
It 's not hard to realise how exhausted we are after a day of shopping .
Think of the awful crowds , the busy car parks , polluted air in the city centres and mile - long queues in front of the cash desks .
I do n't think anyone would really like to face them .
But once you get there , they 're just inevitable , are n't they ?
Well , now before you go shopping , think again and you 'll find out it wo n't be always enjoyable .
Dear Manager ,
I 'm a person , went to see the musical show , I would like to know something about " Over the rainbow " programme ?
The first , you have changed the actor .
The second , the time is late from 19.30 , it started 20.15 .
The third , the tickets have not the discount .
The last , after show , I could n't go to the restaurant , because it was closed .
What 's happened ?
This is the good theatre do , or not ?
This is the famous theatre .
You know , What did people feel ?
Everybody attented go to the show , funny , and happ in the end , and what have we go then ?
Disapponted !
Thank about that .
If you can not managed the programe , why did you informe people before programe start ?
I tought you inderstood ' ; please send money back to me , you know why , do n't answer me ?
Thank you ,
Now we know , our world have developed to new world , becase we have high technology to do .
If we came back to the past , we felt everything , it was so difficult to do , we would have plane and done by ourself and last time .
In the present , the teachnology is a past of life .
It started from got up in the morning , we have the machine help us to cook , iron , cleanning , washing , and then we went out to work , there are car , sky train to travel for help us convenience and quickly .
While we worked at the office , there are the computer and equipment for help to work and easy , after we have finished work , we come back home , there are television for get information , news , data by different way and quickly .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
We appreciated the mordern technology changed my daily life for help every easy and quickly , we have time to do many things .
Dear Mr Robertson ,
Regarding the programme you have organised , it is great ideas everything that you have planed , but I would like to suggest to you something that the students saw in an advertisement .
It is good start to go on sightseeing by bus on Monday morning , we can se all famous buildings in a few hours .
It 's seems relaxing to go to Greenwich in the afternoon looking though the river .
The idea about going to science museum is fantastic , I read about the museum , it is really interesting in science history .
After all morning in the Museum , it is wonderful and on tuesday doing some shops , whereas the student have another idea for tuesday .
On Wednesday after viseted national Art Gallery , we can have a chat about ours next holiday at the free time in the afternoon .
The advertisement that students saw is about a fashion show , but to go to the show you will need cancel the tour on tuesday and add the show , because the show is from 10.00 to 19.00 .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
Freedom !
Nowadays the main attroction in the newspapers and television is private life of famous people .
It is really interesting how people like knowing famous people life .
Without someone famous know , photographs take pictures secretly , try to get money on it .
Sometimes being famous can get stress , everywhere they go there are people around them , especially journalists , trying to ask millions questions .
Famous people deserve to have freedom to do whatever they want , but it is quite difficult to do thing in a public places , because nobody like famous politicians or film stars without asking questions .
On the whole , to be rich and famous do n't always bring happeness , whereas the majority of the population wish they were rich and famous .
Dear Sir or Madam
I am writing to complain about the musical show " Over the rainbow " which was performed in your theatre two weeks ago .
I went to see it on 5th June 2000 .
First of all that evening there was not Danny Brook but an unknown and not very good actor .
Secondly the show started 45 minutes late .
Then at the tickets - office I was said that no discounts were available so I had to pay the full prize despite I am a student .
Finally I would have had dinner at the theatre restaurant if it had not been already closed because the show finished , obviously , late .
I am really not satisfied with the show - organization particularly because in the advertisement you wrote something different .
For this reason I expect to receive my money back .
Yours faithfully
Unfortunately , Pat was n't good at keeping secret .
Last week we had another demostration of this .
On Monday we decided to organize a surprise - party for Ted 's birthday on Tuesday evening .
Each of us had a different task .
Anna prepared the cake , Peter organized the music , Heather and I went to buy the present ; Pat said : " OK I 'll phone to some of Ted 's friends to invite them " .
Obviously Ted should have known nothing about it and we remembered it to Pat twice : " the party is a secret ! ! " and she said : " Yes , it must be a surprise ! "
On Tuesday afternoon we met to prepare the last details ; Pat said : " I 've just phoned to Tommy , Billy and Alison and I met Ted yesterday evening : they all have said ok for the party .. "
In that moment she understood that something was wrong !
Dear Mr Robertson ,
Thank you for organising good programme , especially like sightseeing from River trip to Greenwich in London for three days .
I am writing on behalf of my classmates to give the information of ' The London Fashion And Leisure Show ' which we would like to go and to huggest our opinion .
We have seen an advertisement of last Saturday ' The Times ' edition of the show .
It will be held in Central Exhibition Hall , London or Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 .
Firstly , it will introduce latest fashions connecting Millenium .
Secondly , we will be able to see leisure and sports wear about fashion trend of next year .
It would be fantastic opportunity to the students who study a fashion .
Finally , we can see how to make up and make better hairstyle in the show .
Most of all , It is free for students to enter .
We would like to know if it is possible to change your programme .
We would be grateful if we could go there in the afternoon on 14 March because we are able to go shopping .
We look forward to hearing from you .
Yours Sincerely ,
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
Whenever I recollet it , I feel self - confident .
When I was twenty years old , I had to go to Army .
As you know , my country has been separated into two countries ( South and North Korea ) .
However , instead of going to Army , I was able to apply to Korea Auxiliary Police .
One year later , I was working in Kang - nam police station in Seoul .
Suddenly , the theft signal came into .
So , another policeman and I had to arrive at the accident place quickly .
When we arrived at the place which it happened , one man started running away .
Without any thought , I ran quickly like a swallow .
Then , he tried to go over the wall , I held his leg .
He fell down and we had to stare at each other .
After we fought for a minute , I was able to arrest him .
As a result , I could go on vacation .
When I said to my mother , she asked me not to do it again .
But , I was a police - man .
Therefore , I had to do it in spite of it being dangerous .
Dear Competition Organiser ,
I am writing to replay your letter and to ask more details about the competition .
Firstly , I would like to say that I 'm very glad to have been choosen and I will do my best for this competition .
As you asked in the letter , I would like to travel only on july because I work at the central library and I 'm also having English classes , so I will just have holidays on July .
Is it suitable for you ?
As you mentioned about the accomodation , I would prefer stay in the tents , because it 's more exciting and I really love camping .
I examined all the activities that you listed and I was disappointed to have to chose just two of them because in my opinion I 'm good in almost of this activities .
However , I would choose sailing because I am facinating with the sea and it 's misteries and I also like the watter , the wind in my face ...
The other one I would choose is basketball becouse I 'm tall and very fast with the ball .
Finally I would like to know what kind of clothes are we supposed to wear there , and about the money we are supposed to pay for food and things like that .
I 'm looking forward to receiving your prompt replay .
sincerely
Clara
Dear Kim ,
I am writing to tell you some news and to ask a little bit about you .
First of all , I 'm going to tell the good news .
Last month , I went to a pop concert with four bands .
It was unbelivebly ! ! !
Although it was 5.000 thousand people there , people could walk and dance without any problem .
It was very well organised , the shows started in the exactly time and the group were well performed too .
I have contributed to the concert selling some tickets to my friends .
However the success of the concert , at the end of show some full gays started a big confusion and some people get hurt .
It was depressing ...
Finally , I would like to know some news about you , What have you done ?
Be you studing a lot ?
Please write me a letter as soon as possible !
Love from
Clara .
Dear Helen Ryan ;
I have just received your letter which is made me so hapy . I can not belive that I won first prize in your competition , because I always belived I am an unluky man and now I think somethings are changing in my life .

I have never enjoyed doing shopping , but nowday some people are calling shopcholic .
They are just like alcholics and this people are every day doing shopping because they can not stop themself unless they have not got money for spend .
I can not believe how they doing this things every day , even when I need something at home I alway try to find out something to use instead of that things .
Because nowdays whereever you go there is big queue and I hate being waited .
The queue is not only the problem if you go by car there is parking problem , if you go by bus there is again queue and you have to carry many carry bag carrier bags during the your journey and you wo n't be alway luky to find a seat to seat .
If you go shopping for ( buy ) clothes that is the worse kind of shopping .
Specialy if you want to buy with your girlfriend or if you are already girl you have to be read for hours to spend try on and off .
I realy hate go shopping with girls to buy clothes because when they went into a shop they want try on every single cloth and they do not realise to time .
Some people says " shopping is not alway enjoyable " but for me definity unenjoyable and I think it will be same rest of my life .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing with reference to the musical show I saw last week in your theatre .
I hoped that it would be the most excited evening during my week 's holiday in London .
Unfortunately it was n't .
I would n't like to be unkind but I must say that the advertisement for the show included a lot of false information .
First of all , when I had bought the ticets it appeared that there is no discount available .
Secondly , I must complain that the musical show started almost an hour later and in addition to this anyone did n't excuse .
Moreover I would like to ask why Danny Brook , which is my favourite actor , did n't play in the show .
Furthermore I would like to enquire why the theatre restaurant was closed .
Finally , I must say that I had a very disappointing evening and I would like to get my money back .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Your faithfully
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I wish I had know it two days ago ... Exacly on 15th June we were at the birthday party .
Dora wanted me to come with Pat because she was in love with him .
I really like Dora and Pat and I just wanted to help them to be together , but it was n't such a good idea .
I thought that if I said something specific about her he would look at her in a different way .
Well , I forgot that it 's just a boy !
I should n't have told him that she was a virgin .
It was awful when he started to laugh and everybody was stearing at us .
Yesterday I discovered that he told everything to Marl and Tony .
I really regret that I was so foolish .
The most horrible is the fact that my friendship with Dora seems to be on the rocks and I do n't know what I have to do to overcome the difficulties .
Mr. Manager :
I am writing this letter to you because when I went to your Musical show I had a very bad time .
Firstly when I went to the show it was writing that the starting time was 19.30 but it started at quarter past eight I had waitted for fourthey five minutes .
Secondly the stars were going to be DANNY BROOK and TINA TRUELOVE but different people came to the show .
It was the first time I was going to go to a musical show but I guess it will be the last one too .
Anyway after the show I felt hungry so I went to the restaurant but it was closed because they were having the inside altered .
And as last that was the worse night I had ever had so I asked for my money back but they would n't give it so I had an argument with the people Who worked their but I could n't get my money back .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Because last year I started smoking and nobody knew that I was smoking but one day as I was smoking at the back of the school some one came next to me and I noticed that it was Pat .
She saw me as I was smoking so that was n't going to be very good .
She said that she would n't tell it to anyone but I knew she might say it to someone so I always was with her very minute ever second .
But one day as I was walking home like every night I saw Pat at the front of our house door talking to my dad .
I just knew I could n't have trusted to her but as I went in the house my dad offered pot to stay for meal I was in a schock thinking why is n't anyone getting angry to me after a while we sat for dinner and Pat just talk my parents that I was smoking and when my family heard they got ever so angry .
I could n't go out of the house for a month so now I know how Pat is and ca n't keep any secrets .
Dear Mister
I 'm writing to you to complain about the musical show you present at the moment : " Over the Rainbow " .
As my husband is a native and we live in Switzerland , we apreciate to pass a week in London every year .
We are keen on theatre and musical show .
Your theatre is known to present excellent spectacles .
We were never disappointed so far and especially enjoyed " The Drama " you presented last year .
Anyway we had a very disappointing evening .
At first , we could n't get any discount , although you mention it on your advertisment .
And the only tickets left were at £ 20 .
Then the spectacle began 45 minutes later than mentioned .
Last but not least , Danny Brook was replaced by a different actor , whose name I probably forgot because of his poor performance .
Afterwards we are used to eat at your restaurant which is not only well known for it 's good price value but also for it 's original decoration .
Therefore I ask you to give use £ 20 back , because the two tickets were not more worth .
I 'm looking forward to hearing soon from you .
yours faithfully
Unfortunately , Pat was n't really good at keeping secrets .
The following story will prove it .
I left the office at six o'clock .
I was free as the air .
My husband was following a course all the week in Berne .
The kids were by their grandmother , who take care of them .
I drove to Ouchy where I took a drink .
It was so hot , I decided to go for a swim in tutry , although I had n't any swimming - clothes .
I knew a good place .
I parked the car and went ten minuts .
As I had planed , the place was deserted .
I took my clothes of and swam twenty minutes in the lake .
Coming back , I noticed that my clothes were missing .
I walked back , hoping I would n't come accross anyone and be able to drive back home .
The car was missing too .
Unfortunately a police car drove by and the policeman saw me standing there nude .
They drove me to their office after having given me use of their shirt .
There I called Pat who picked me up .
I felt so miserable that Pat laughed seeing me .
Of course she told everything to my husband .
If only Pat could keep secrets !
Dear Jane Clark ,
I am writing to thank you for providing International Arts Festival .
It was absolutely great idea .
However , I would like to give some suggestions for next year as I have read the advertisement .
Firstly , could you invite stars and artists from more than only six contries ?
In my opinion , it might be better to have time with variety nationallites .
Secondly , the music concerts were very exciting and had a lot of fun , but some concert halls were too small to enjoy them comfortably .
Thirdly , I am expecting to watch more films and plays which were impressive .
Lastly , it could be nice to students who are interested in arts , if you help special events , for instance , song contest , writing competition or dance lessons .
To sum up , I hope the festival is developed next year with excellent reasonably - priced ticket like this year 's .
Yours sincerely ,
PART TIME JOBS : Find in your place
Do you need money ?
That is very important to find a way for earning and saving money .
Probably the best way you can get money is to have a part time job in your spare time .
I am recommending you to check your possible time to work - weekdays or weekend ? - before you request a job .
If you just decide to work , you 'd better to find a job in your place .
Firstly , go to your school or local council .
They will be able to help to find safe and suitable jobs for students like you .
Secondly , as your family or friends .
As they know about your interestings and personality , it is easy to help you .
In conclusion , do n't forget that a job is just spent in your " spare " time .
That 's it !
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing to make a complaint about the show ' Over the Rainbow ' .
During my stay in London I went to your theatre to see this show .
As it is said in your advertisement , the show is starring Danny Brook but there was different actor .
It is not the only problem .
The show had to start at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 .
You promised that there will be discounts , but when I came , I found out , that they were not available .
I wanted to go to your restaurant .
I invited a friend of mine and promised her that we will go there .
And what I found out .
Your restaurant was closed .
You promised that if we go to your show we will have a perfect evening .
Everything was just vice versa .
I am very disappointed , that is why I am asking you for compensation .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
Unfortunately , Pat was not very good at keeping secrets .
It happened at the end of school year .
My class was going to a night disco and I wanted to go there too .
I asked my parents if I could go , but they did not let me do that .
I tried to persuade them , told that nothing will happen to me , promised to do all housework .
But all they have done is told me that I am to young for it and I can go there only when I am 20 years old .
I had such a desire to go to the disco , that I decided to go even without parent 's permission .
I told my secret to my best friend Pat .
But she told it to very kid in school , even the teachers heard it .
It occured that one of the teachers told my parents about it .
At the end I was punished and stayed at home for two weeks .
I understood that I must keep my secrets and do not tell anybody , even the best friend .
Dear Mrs. Jane X ,
I would like to make some appoitments about the event that I had been .
First of all , the concert hall is too small to have a great concert .
I think should be bigger for jazz , rock or still classical concerts .
Secondly , I had some ideas for the next year events , such as :
- Funny plays and films to spend the break time ;
- Dance shows after dinner to have something interesting to do in the night ,
- Art exbitions to know more things about artist 's lifestyle ; and
- talks by writers to say how good is his latest book .
In addictions , the ticket 's price is too expensive and difficult to buy another one every day , so , I think is more effective if was one reasonably - priced weekend ticket for all events .
In conclusion , I hope will be better next year if these points was observed for the each year the event to be better than before .
Sincerely
How are you ?
It was nice to receive notices about you .
I remember these time in our class when us talking many time about rules and I am missing that time so much .
Well , about rules in my contry , is not different than another countries .
The rules must be respect for all people if you do n't want get out from scholl .
You must to be organise , clean and respect the right of other people ..
Dear The Manager of the Circle Theatre ,
While I was staying in London for a holiday , I went to the Circle Theatre to see OVER THE RAINBOW in the evening .
That made me feel disappointed .
First of all , the actor was different from your advertisement .
I meant he was not Danny Brook .
Secondly , it took times to wait about forty five minutes , because it started at 20:15 .
It should be on time at 19:30 .
Then it had no discounts , which the advertisement said so .
Due to being a student , I think I should have got the discount from your ticket with ID card .
Besides this , the theatre restaurant was early closed .
As soon as the show ended , I went to there for having a dessert .
Lastly , I do n't think that it was my perfect evening .
I would like to get my money back .
I look forward to replying from you .
Yours faithfully ,
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Griffin , who is a teacher , was n't surprised at our preparation .
It was so close to be on his birthday , so we made a decision to hold a small party for him .
She has just learnt with us for three weeks .
She is not talkative , kind , and reserved .
However , this party she took part in , she was responsible for preparing food .
As far as we knew , she 's good at cooking .
While she was choosing vegetables in a market , she came across him .
When he asked her ' why do you choose deliberately ? ' , she answered without thinking .
That caused the secret disclosed .
We did n't blame her , because we knew that she did n't intend to do like that .
Although he was n't surprised , he was glad and pleased with our party .
Anyway , Happy Birthday to Griffin , again .
Dear Jean Clark ,
I recently spent two days at your Annual International Arts Festival and I am writing to express my opinion about it .
Firstly , I think the International Arts Festival is a wonderful idea because I have the opportunity to enjoy different arts events .
But it is also true I could just see stars and artists on stage from only six countries , not stars from around the world as you announce in your advertisement .
Secondly I really enjoyed the jazz and classical concerts in spite of the fact that some of them were taken place in too small concert halls .
Thirdly , all the plays and films showed were interesting , In my opinion you should include some more films and plays in your festival next year .
Finally , I think it was a good idea the fact to buy only one ticket for all the events since I just spent the time watching and enjoying all of them .
I look forward hearing from you .
Your sincerely
Dear George ,
Sorry it 's been too long since I last wrote but I 've been so busy at school that I could n't answer you before .
As you tell me in your last letter you were talking about rules in your class and you want to know about school rules in my country and also what I am allowed to do at home .
First I must tell you that teachers are strict at school .
We are n't allowed to eat in the classrooms and in addition to this we must sit down in individual desks .
We ca n't chat with our classmates .
How boring !
At home everything is quite good , mum and dad are great but there 's one main rule I must tell them were I go and what time I 'll come back .
Granny is the problem she 's a bit bossy !
She usually tells me what to do and what kind of clothes I should wear but I do n't care about it .
I really must get down to some homework now so I 'll stop here .
Give my love to your parents .
Write to me soon
Dear Mr Robertson ,
I am writing to you as a representative of the class about the 3-day school trip which has been organized for next week .
First of all , I would like to thank you for the excellent organization of this trip which seems to be very interesting and useful for the students .
Especially I believe that the visit to the National Art Gallery will be a really exciting experience for all of us .
All the students are enthusiastic about it .
However , some of them have read an advertisment about the London Fashion and Leisure Show , which will take place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on 14th March .
The Exhibition will show all the latest fashion in a very wide range from sports wear to make up and even hairstyles .
What is more , the show is free for all the students .
We feel that taking part to it would be a great opportunity to us since we will be able to have some information about the world of fashion , which is becoming more and more important in our days .
Under the circumstances , I was asked by the class to inform you about the show and to ask if it could be possible to make some changes in the programme if it could to visit the Exhibition .
It will take place on Tuesday from 10.00am to 19.00pm , so we could give up the shopping and go to the show in the afternoon .
I hope you will consider this possibility and tell us as soon as possible if you intend to accept our proposal .
Yours faithfully
Being famous and risk is something all of us have dreamt of sometimes .
But not always famous people are happy of their condition .
Usually if you ask them what they would desire most , the answer is : " I would like to be able to live like ordinary people do "
There is no surprise to this answer : famous people can not have their own private life .
Whenever they go out they are suddenly " hounded " by groups of journalists and photographers who want an interview or a photo .
But the worst thing of all is that they are often victim of malicious gossips , which most of the times are not even true .
In conclusion , I believe that it is certainly tight that famous people accept their condition , with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings , on the other hand , however , I think that they deserve to have a private life as all other people have .
Also the most famous star can be unhappy and depresed : not always , in fact , money and celebrity being happiness .
Dear Mr Robertson ,
Thank you for the programme which you have organised the three days in London .
However , some students in our class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to have an opportunity to go to the show .
The show is opened between ten and seven p.m on Tuesday , March 14 at Central Exhibition Hall in London .
Latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles are expected to be displayed and studied .
We have concerned it as a great opportunity to touch a part of latest cultures , which are concentrated and sharpened in London .
In addition , the addmission for students is free .
Taking the programme and the show into consideration , we suggest that we can have time to go to the show in the afternoon on Tuesday .
We suppose that in free time on Wednesday we can find some time for shopping .
We hope that you consider our suggestion .
Yours sincerily ,
The ways of living are always changing .
It is no doubt that functions and structures of the home have been changing as well as that of transformation , for example , have been .
Thinking about the home of the future , first of all , nuclear families should be expected because of new technologies , which make house - keeping easier and simpler and because of the idea which encourages us to live in cities for convenient life .
People may tend to avoid from living in a large number of families in an expected small house in a city .
On the other hand , the bond between parents and children should be unlikly to change .
People always need their parents , children and so on .
New materials will surly change the home of the future in any ways .
Hopefully , the minds of people will stay peaceful and tender in the future .
Dear Mrs. Ryan ,
Thank you for your letter .
I was very surprised that I have won the first prize in your competition .
First I would like to mention that I can only travel in July , because I will work in August in a web designer studio .
So I am unable to go on holiday to another time .
I would prefer to stay in a tent because I like camping very much .
I think it 's more exciting to be in a tent than in a log cabin .
I was very surprised that you offer such a great variety of sports and courses .
I would like to do Basketball and Painting .
I played Basketball at school for about two years .
I am rather good in it .
I also had Painting as main subject at school for five years .
I like painting very much , and I think I am good in Painting .
I paint a lot in my free time .
I prefer painting landscapes and fantasy - pictures .
I would like to ask you , how much money will we need ?
Which clothes should we take with us ?
I hope to hear from you soon .
Yours sincerely
First I would like to point out , that this was a good idea to present our school in a short film .
I think first of all we should film an english lesson , where pupils could prepare some group work or information - boards .
I think it is also important to present a comercial english lesson , maybe the pupils could write " offers and orders " or enquiries on the blackboard .
Next I would film a BWPM lesson .
This subject teachs the pupils how to make good presentations .
They go together in groups , then they prepare power point presentations and at least they present it in front of the other pupils and teachers .
It would be also very interesting to film the situation during the brake .
The smokers in the school yard , the buffett and the other pupils , who are sitting in front of their tables writing their homework .
I think then we should film an informatic - lesson .
It would be funny to present the computers , which are often overcharged , or often the netserver is spinning .
It 's really funny to see the helpless teacher , who wants to go on writing in excel or a word text , while the computers do not work or brake down .
I think that would be all for our video .
In my opinion this are the most interesting things in our school .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to complain about your entertainment which was advertised in the last edition of " Plays " .
I am afraid that reality had nothing common with the things I suspected to meet .
Then , I expected the show to start on time , but it turned out that I had to wait 45 minutes .
Moreover , when the play started at last , I could n't look at the actors .
Especially I was disappointed by Danny Brook who made me nervous with his lack of talent .
According to your advertisement , there was a possibility to have dinner in your restaurant , but I was surprised when I found it closed .
After that , I should also mention , that this evening was dull , boring and the worst in my life .
I am looking forward to hearing from you and I insist that you refund my lost money at once .
Yours faithfully ,
Come back to paradise
There is no doubt that fashion affects people and makes them obsessed with this subject , but what can be designed more ?
Can you imagine the trend which will be as shocking as it has never been ?
The clothes is part of each culture and one of these things which expresses our taste and personality .
People spend a lot of money to buy something extraordinary , feel comfortable and stand out .
They come up with many ideas but it ca n't last for a long time .
Nowadays it 's getting obvious that designers sold only details , but significant changes do n't turn up .
Styles mix , colours and shapes come back from the past , only the fabrics are different .
People look for something new but it is not so easy to be creative all the time . Teenagers are bored with casual fashion and their parents laugh at them because of the fact they wear common clothes .
That 's why I believe in the solution which is the closest to human nature and can help us to omit the boredome I am sure that at last we will take off our clothes and in the future we will be undressed and free there wo n't be any problem with being up - do - date .
As it was previously stated I am convinced that the reality will turn out to be a paradise where the most important will be body and purity of our soul .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing in connection with the musical show I saw in your theatre a week ago .
Although the show was supposed to be the London 's newest and best musical show , I am rather disappointed with it .
Firstly , I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook and Tina Truelove on the stage .
However , you changed actors without informing viewers .
As if this were not enough , the show was forty five minutes late .
Your leaflet was rather misleading on this subject .
According to your leaflet , tickets were supposed to be a bit cheaper , but I was refused being given a discount .
On top of everything , the theatre restaurant was closed .
You can imagine how disappointed I must be to spent such an imperfect evening .
I demand a full refund or I will be forced to take this mater further .
I look forward to receiving your prompt reply .
Yours faithfully ,
Recently , we have had a very interesting discussion about how science and technology affects our lives .
My life has also changed as a result of modern technology .
Thanks to computers , phones , mobile phones , internet I can communicate with other people faster than I was able to do before .
My father is a sailor and I meet him only four times a year .
But thanks to mobile phone I can contact him even if he is sailing in the Atlantic Ocean .
I also enjoy shopping through internet .
This way I do n't have to do be queuing in shops and supermarkets and I can choose fashionable clothes .
In the future I would love to be a doctor , especially a cardiologist .
Nowadays , modern technology is used in medicine more often and it can minimise the risk of the death of the patients .
However , I can see some disadvantages of technological progress .
First of all , I spend too much time indoors playing computer or watching TV . I know that if I want to keep fit and stay healthy , I must take up some sport .
Moreover , modern technology has made our environment more polluted .
That 's why we should abandon cars from city centres , closed down factories which produce too much sewage .
Although modern progress has made our life easier , it may be also harmful .
We should all be aware of these consequences of modern technology and use it considerably .
Dear Helen Ryan ,
I am writing to answer all the questions that you made me in your last letter .
First of all , I wanted to thank you for giving me the first prize in your competition .
It is very important for me , because I always wanted to travel to the U.S.A.
I would be able to travel only in July because it is the only month when I do n't have to go to school .
I would prefer to stay in a tent because as I had never slept in a tent , it would be a new experience for me .
The two activities that I choose are : basketball and climbing .
I am a very good basketball player because I have been playing basketball since I was six years old .
By the other side , I have never climbed a mountain but I always wanted to do it .
I wondered which kind of clothes I should take to the camp and I wanted to know how much money I should take .
I look forward to knowing the date of the camp .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Kim ,
Thank you for your last letter .
It was very interesting and I enjoyed reading it .
As you know , I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month .
It was a very good experience and I am going to tell you all about it .
First of all , I had to sell tickets for the concert in the street .
As I sold all the tickets that the organisers gave me , I won a prize of ten pounds .
Do n't ask me how the concert was !
Because during the concert I was working in the kitchen of the stadium bar , preparing sandwiches .
I am angry because I could n't watch the artists performing their songs .
When the concert was finished , some friends and I went for a drink .
It was a very important experience for me because I learnt all about the organisation of a pop concert .
Looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours ,
Dear Mr Robertson
My name is ... and I am a student representative .
I am writing to you on behalf of my class concerning our trip to London .
First of all I would like to thank you for organizing the programme .
I read it and found it very good , specially , Science Museum and National Art Gallery as I am interested in arts .
However , I have a great proposition for you .
Students in my class have recently seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
I thing it is a great opportunity for us , as it is at the time of our being in London and is free of charge for students .
Girls should like to see the latest fashion , new make - up and interesting hairstyles .
Boys are interested in seeing leisure and sportswear .
I would like to suggest a change in the programme by giving up shopping and going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
I hope you will consider this proposition and I am looking forward to hearing form you .
Yours sincerely
THE HOME OF THE FUTURE
Home is an important element in everybody 's life .
It gives you safety .
I do not know people who would not want to have a home .
We like our houses that is why are always trying to make it more comfortable and useful .
I think The Home of the Future will be bigger as we will need more room for us , our belongings and interests .
The construction will be more simple what will give us a feeling of balance .
More houses will have gardens what will make us feel closer to the nature .
Many people think that we will resign from a kitchen which is a useless place , as we will spend most of the time at work and will eat outside .
I do not think so .
Because of computers we will have the possibility of working at home , therefore , home will be very important place worth paying attention .
Take care of your home , do not hesitate in it and you will be very happy .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I went to the Circle Theatre to see the musical show " Over The Rainbow . "
Unfortunately , I had a very disappointing evening , because very little of what was offered in the advertisements was provided .
Firstly , we were informed that Danny Brook was starring but a different actor was starring in the show and he was really disappointing .
Secondly , in the advertisement it was written that the show was to start at 19:30 .
However , it started at 20:15 , almost an hour late .
Thirdly , it was written that discounts were available but we were again frustrated , seing they were not available .
Finally , although we were informed that the theatre restaurant would be open after the show , it was closed because the show had started late .
We did not have " a perfect evening " as it was written , actually we had an evening full of the theatre 's mistakes and were extremely disappointed .
I suppose it will be better for your theatre 's reputation to give at least some of my money back .
Yours Sincerely ,
MY LIFE AND MODERN TECHNOLOGY
Here we are , in the 21st century ... We live in a technologically well - developed world , having every opportunity for communication , education and entertainment .
Almost everyone has televisions , computers and electronic devices .
But how has modern technology changed our lives ?
If I were to talk about my own life , my speech would be simple : " My electronic alarm - clock wakes me up in the morning .
I go to school by underground .
When I come home , I cook my meal in the microwave .
In my spare time , I watch television , play with my computer , or chat in the internet ... " There is no sentence without electronic devices .
I wonder what I could do without them ... I do n't go out with my friends or read books .
I have friends in the internet and can learn anything while surfing in it .
I sometimes get bored or feel isolated , because I know I am living in a virtual world .
When I look at my life , I can understand I am dependent on the machines .
My daily life is programmed up to the virtual world I created .
Modern technology has changed my life completely .
Dear Ms. Jane Clark ,
I am writing to give my opinion about the International Arts Festival which was held 21st and 22nd November .
I went to the rock concert by U2 and the Chinese film " Chung King Express " .
Both of them were not only really enjoyable , but also reasonably - priced .
However , I feel that it would be even better if there were some improvement .
First of all , it would be greater if there were more famous people who have various nationalities .
Because most of them were from English speaking country this year .
In addition , larger halls should be provided for concerts since a lot of people could not get tickets for those by big stars .
Moreover , personally , I hope that the number of plays and films will increase .
I would be glad if you consider my suggestions .
Yours sincerely ,
Money - hasn't it always been one of the most important problem for students ?
Of course , you ca n't afford a luxualy car and a large apartment unless you 've born with a silver spoon .
However , there are some good ways for you to earn enough money to enjoy yourself .
How about working as a waiter or waitress ?
Not only it 's a simple job , but also you can enjoy working with many colleague at your age .
It would be great fan to make friends outside your class or club .
If you say that the wage is far from satisfaction , why do n't you teach younger students as a private teacher .
It 's also really popular job among university students because of the good salaly .
If you are interested in teaching and responsible enough , you 'll probably become an excellent teacher .
Stop complaining about lack of money and let 's start working to have a new world .
You 'll find that your life is becoming more and more enjoyable !
Dir Madam
I 'm writing to you in reply to your letter .
I was really suprised when I opened it .
I look forword to going to the Camp California in the USA .
I would like to travel only in July because my family is going to visit me on August and I will have to look after them .
I prefer staying in tens to staying in log cabins .
Because it remainds me my childhood . I used to going with my friends to the camp , wich was situeded on a seaside .
We had always enjoying ourselves .
Never had I got such a great time .
From your 's list of activities I choose sailing and climbing .
I 'm keen on sailing , it is my favourite sport .
I find it very atractive .
I have been sailing since my father had bought a boat in 1980 , when I was only five years old .
However , I have never taken part in any competitions connected with this sport .
For me it is only a hobby .
Last year I took up climbing and I want to carry on learning this sport .
I would like to ask what kinds of clothes should I take with me . and I wonder if prizes are high there .
Yours faithfully
Angelina
I used to like shopping , but recently I came across many disadvantage of this activity .
Most people think that if they have got money they will buy everything what they want .
It is n't true .
Nowdays we have many big shopping centers .
We like them because everything is on one place .
The most suitable time for shopping is weekand when parents do n't work and children haven't got a school .
Because of that shopping centers are over crowded .
You ca n't buy something in peacful and calm athmospher .
In addition in such kind of shops prizes are very high , of course not all of them .
However such centers are very useful and necessary .
I my opinion the worst thing which may happened is extremly hugh queu to the changing room .
It is really exhausting .
Afterwards you are all in .
Nevertheless sometimes shopping could be enjoyable .
If you bought something goregous , you would be very happy .
On balance I think that shopping should be a nice thing so if you have bad mood do n't go shopping .
Dear Mr. Robertson
First of all , I want to thank you in the name of the class for your good organisation and programme , Especially for the fact that you are giving us some free time .
We really appreciate this .
However , we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
The show is on Tuesday the 14th of March , from 10 oo to 19 oo o'clock in the Central Exhibition Hall .
There will be shown the latest fashions about leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles .
This is a great opportunity for us , because we haven't been ever before in this kind of show .
As well as this , the entrance for students is free .
As you can see this is the best time to go there .
We have some suggestions about how to change the programme .
Instead of visiting the Science Museum on Tuesday we could go there on Wednesday afternoon and instead of going shopping on Tuesday afternoon we could maybe stop at some places during the sightseeing tour and buy there something .
To sum up , this is a really great opportunity for us and I do n't think that the changes are so big .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerelly
The man is a being that need to live close to other human beings and to create a society around him .
As well as this he needs his own free space and privacy .
This is also important to him as friendship and family
In our society some people are treated like animals in the zoo by the press .
Just because they are famous and well known to a high number of other people .
The newspapers print everything about them .
The yellow press is searching for every little information they can get .
The photographers are chasing these people , just to take a picture of them on how they eat or with who the meat .
The photos will be on tomorrow 's press and so rumours are born .
On the other hand the people have choose to walk on this path .
Everything in life has a price .
The price for fame and money is the lost of privacy .
First of all you have to give up something for getting something else .
However , the press should n't create rumours and hunt those people like animals .
As well as this , the stars should n't complaint at any time about their fans and their lost of privacy .
They wanted to be famous and the had known the price before .
The fans and the press are those who have made them rich and famous .
Dear Sir or Madam !
I 'm writing to you because of the musical show " Over the rainbow " , wich I visited on Friday the 16th of June in your theatre .
There are several points I have to complain wich made the evening not nice at all .
At first the show started much later than it was written out .
Instead of half past seven the show startet at quarter past eight . I could n't go to have a refreshment because of two reasons , the first one is that there was no information how much time the start of the show is going to be late .
The second reason is that the restaurant of the theatre was closed because of building plans for the next two month .
After I waited for about 45 minutes the show suddenly started but I had to realize that the main actor Danny Brook , who was the reason why I went into the show had been traded by an other actor , who could n't sing as half as good then Brook .
On your ticket information is written out that discounts are available , when I ask at the ticket reception I could n't get any discount for beeng student .
To make an result the evening in your theatre and the show was very disappointing and not like promised .
For these reasons I want to ask you to get my money of £ 25 back .
Miss. Winkler
What is the prize ?
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
He did n't want to say what Sarah just had told him , it just came over his mouth , when he talked to James .
" Sarah has won in a quiz show ? " James was more than just interested , he wanted to know what she had won .
But Pat made a promise not to tell anybody about the quiz show and he already had told enough .
After one hour the hohle class had heard about Sarah 's secret .
Everybody was interested in what she had won but knowbody wanted to ask Sarah because it was told in a secret to them .
Sarah realized that everybody was nice and friendly to her but something was going on in the class , when she turned around a talking and wispering started .
Suddenly , she went to Pat and asked him did you tell anybody about our secret .
Pat told her everything .
Sarah looked at him for a while , than she stood in front of the class and explaind to the others , that she won a prize for 20 people to travel for 1 week to the sea of southern France and everybody of the 19 pupils was invited , except Pat who was n't very good at keeping secrets .

Dear Sir ,
I am waiting this letter re fearing to the show " over the Rainbow " you presented the 10 of this month .
I read your advertissement five days before , and I was realy impressed by it .
But , the quality of this show was n't what you let understand , an I feel realy disappointed by it .
I want to give you some details about my feelings .
First of all , you presented a starring composed with Danny Brook , but he was n't there !
Secondly , the show should start at 19.30 , and in fact it started 45 minutes late .
Then , I am a student , and when I bought my ticket , there was n't any discounts .
Finally , I hoped that I could have a diner in the restaurant after the show , but , to make my totally disappointed , it was closed , and I had to find another restaurant at 22.00 .
So you can imagine how I am satisfied by your pretending " Perfect Evening " .
For all these reasons , and if you want to keep me a costumer , I would be gratfull if you give me some or all my money back .
Looking forward to hearing from you ,
Yours sincerly ,
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
My marks was n't good enought to obtain my degree in Computer Science , and the exam session was finished .
There was no solutions to finally obtain the diploma .
You need more explanations about me to understand my motivations at the end of this story .
In fact , I did this kind of studies because of my interests in programming .
The problem is that I ca n't keep calm during an exam to succeed .
That 's why I decided to hack the teacher 's computers to change all my marks .
I never talked about this project to anyone , exept my best friend Pat .
At the end of the exam session , all students and teachers meet together for a big party , to celebrate it .
During this party , Pat drank too much .
And when he was totally drunk , he started speaking .
Then , the teachers made copies of their file , and my project was n't possible anymore .
So congratulation everybody .
And I think I will still be there next year .
Dear Mr Robertson ,
Many thanks for the programme you have organised .
It is really interesting and diversity at the same time .
There is just one thing I want to tell you ; Janine and Richey have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show and we all would like to go to the show .
That is in the central Exhibition Hall , near the hotel , and it is only about fashion : latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles .
I think it could be very interesting and it is free for students ( what is really good ) .
It is a great opportunity because this show is only each two years and normaly it is difficult to go in .
And , as you know we all are interested in fashion .
In my opinion , I would suggest to go to the show instead of the National Art Gallery because we could go there another time .
Or , going to the show on wensday morning and on the afternoon , we can choose between free time or National Art Gallery .
I look farward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
I went out of the room , ran as much as I could and started thinking what this man was doing here and who he was .
When I arrived in the street it was dark , windy , but I could see a shadow at the corner of the opposite street .
By the time I arrived here , he has disappeared .
Suddenly , I felt very tired and decided to go home .
I took her in my arms and opened the door : my mother was sitting in a chair , reading a book , with blood all around her .
I finally realized that she was dead .
The police arrived twenty minutes later , took my mother and checked to see what could be interesting to find the murder : lucky , the knife which he used to kill her was still here and in fact they could arrested him .
They found hime two months after and six months after he was in jail .
To forget everything , I moved to Irkind with my sister in a small house in the countryside .
Everything was going on , when one day , I came in the house and found my mother sitting in a chair reading a book , with blood all around her .
Dear Sir
I write a letter to complain about your advertisement about the musical show " over the rainbow " , wich is misleading in a number of way .
Firstly we arrived at 19.15 to be in time for the show , which should have started at 19.30 .
However it started at 20.15 and we were all very disappointed .
Furthermore , it 's written in your advert that Danny Brook is in the play and that was one of the main reason to why we went .
Imagine how disappointed we got when we found out that he had been replaced .
Besides , when we wanted to buy our tickets we were hoping that the discounting was available .
Unfortunately , it was n't and we could n't afford bying everyone a ticket .
Finally , after the show we had planed to eat diner at the theatre restaurant and we were very disappointed when it turned out to closed .
Therefor , as you may understand I 'm asking for a refund .
These kinds of misadventures can easily ruin your reputation .
I look forward to hearing from you
Your sincerely ,
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets and the rumours describing me stealing soon reached the director 's office .
I was send a letter in which it was written that the director wanted to meet me and my parents .
Sweating and affraid I waited out side the director 's office the following day .
I was unable to image what would happen to me if my parents knew what I had stolen .
' You may enter ' said the director .
Tairs ran down my face as I admitted having stolen .
I was suprised that my father did n't watch me but I soon understood that he was ignoring me .
Mother , on the other hand , looked at me and seemed both disappointed and betrayed .
During the trip home non of us spoke .
We just sat calmly waiting for this nightmare to be over .
The same evening my father pronounced a few words : ' May this be the end of your thief career we are only ready to forgive if you promiss never to start again '
Dear Mrs Ryan ,
I am writing to answer to your letter in which you told me I won first prize in our competetion , which is two weeks , I was very happy with this result since I did not think I could win .
First of all I would like to tell you that I will be able to travel only in July because in the other months I will be too busy with my work .
In the second place I add that I would prefer an accomodation in a tent , even though it is not very comfortable , because I want to put myself to the test by living in a condition I am not used to .
Besides this , in connexion with the activities we will have the chance to do , I would like to inform you that I choose swimming and tennis because I am quite good at both , especially at tennis .
In addition to this I would like to ask you which kind of clothes and how much money it is necessary to have , since I am undecided about it not knowing the cost of life in California .
I look forward to hearing from you soon ,
Yours Sincerely ,
Marino Rizzo
The aim of this report is to suggest which activities of our daily life at school shoud be filmed to give the other students the idea of what we usually do not only during the lessons but also the rest of the time .
Most of the students agree in saying that two are the main features of our daily life at school which should be filmed : it would be very funny to dwell on us working and speaking together without the help of the teacher to show our efforts and sometimes successful and sometimes ridiculous and also to film some amusing moments we spent waiting for the teacher .
A little percentage , on the contrary , said it would be very useful to film the teacher when she is explaining us something important , to give the idea of the real life in our classroom . which is the most .
Mr. Manager :
The porpouse of this letter is to complain about my experience with the musical show " Over the Rainbow " , wich really disapointed me .
First of all , there were no diccounts avaible as it said on the anouncement so I had to pay the original price wich was n't cheap at all .
Then , I was forced to wait fourty five minutes to see the show because it started at 20:75 in stead of 19:30 and when it finally started , I was really disapointed to see that the actors were n't Danny and Tina as it said on the anouncement .
Finally , when the show finished , I could n't visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed for repairs .
So , as you can see , it was n't my perfect evening out at all that 's why I demand you to send me my money back .
Your really unsatisfied costomer
How has modern technology afected my daily life ?
Since the begining of human life , people have invented ways to make their life easier .
That is not difference from now .
We live sorrounded by inventions wich help as through the day .
From the vehicle we use to move faster to the light bulb we use at night , we constantly depends on these inventions to be able to make the things we have to do .
That 's why modern technology is so important in our daily life , because it helps to make our life easiest and to do what we have to do faster so then we can use better our time .
Warsaw , 13th of June 2000
Dear Mrs. Ryan ,
I am writing in response to your letter which I received two days go and in order to answer all questions I was asked to .
First of all , the only month I will be able to visit the U.S.A. is July due to the fact that I have already arranged another trip for August .
Second of all , I would prefer to live in a tent .
I am used to this kind of accommodation since I have been taking part in survival camps for a long time .
As far as the activities are concerned , I have chosen sailing and surfing .
The reason of my decision is that other activities are availiable to take also in my county , except climbing , but I have fear of heights so this one is not destinated for people like me .
Furthermore , I would like to ask you some questions .
What type of clothes should I take and how much money would be enough ?
Is this a kind of " all inclusive " holidays ?
Thank you in advance .
Yours faithfully ,
Ursula Sobczak

Dear Kim ,
I think I told you about my plans of entering a group that helps at concerts , did n't I ?
Well , I took my chance and I was chosen to help at Michael Jackson 's concert .
Amazing , is n't it ?
The event took place a month ago in the Rock Stadium .
There was about 100 000 people .
We had a lot of things to do .
Acctually , they put me very close to the stage , in the middle of the real hell .
Many people fainted and some of them , the most serious cases , had to be taken to hospital .
The biggest problem was connected with some foreigners who could n't speak Polish or English and we did n't know how to help them .
Despite this fact , the atmosphere was terrific .
After the concert many people lost their way home , mostly foreigners who did n't know the buses ' schedule .
We had to order taxis for them as they did n't have mobile telephones .
However , they were very nice people .
I did n't manage to meet Michael as I had expected , but apart from that , I really enjoyed time I spent there .
You should also try .
Best wishes ,
Ursula .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I 'm writing to complain about a musical show which I 've seen recently at your theatre .
There are several reasones why I was n't satisfied with it .
Firstly , it was written in the advertisement that a famous actor Danny Brook would play in the show .
Despite it , a different actor stared in the performance , which was really disappointing .
Secondly , the beginning of the show was 45 minutes later than it was supposed to be .
Thirdly , no discounts were made when I was buying the tickets .
Lastly , the theatre restaurant was closed after the show .
That evening was n't my perfect one out , although it was promised to be so in the advertisement .
This is the main reasone , why I want to ask for a refund .
In my opinion , this would be quite fair .
I 'm going to visit the Circle Theatre this Sunday .
I hope I 'll get at least a part of the money I 've paid back .
Yours faithfully ,
Fashion of the Future .
During the centuries man 's clothes has been changing and even developing in some way .
People wore clothes made from metal , which were rather heavy , I suppose .
They wore enormous luxurious dresses , which , in my opinion , you ca n't feel very comfortable in .
Nowadays people wear more common clothes .
I think we can make a conclusion : during the centuries man 's clothes have been becoming less heavy and luxurious and more common .
People 's clothes have been changing from metalwear to shorts and miniskirts .
That 's why I suppose , that man 's clothes will be becoming more and more light .
I think , they will be made of universal materials , which will be rather light and thin .
People wo n't be embarassed to show the beauty of their bodies .
Perhaps , clothes will be rather small .
I think , that different tops and mini - skirts will become more popular .
Maybe , people will create something even smaller than that .
Who knows what will happen in the future ?
Perhaps , metalwear will become a craze again .
Dear Mrs Helen Ryan ,
I am very happy to have won the first prize of the competition , and I am going to clear up some details you asked me in your letter .
Firstly , because of my school exam , I would like to travel only july .
Moroever , I have chosen this month because I think the weather will be fine .
At Camp California , I hope I will be in tents because I like very much this kind of style life : I love the contact with the nature .
On the other handDuring my stay in Camp California , I want to go swimming because I practice this activitie regularly and I often do competitions : this is one of my hobbies .
In addition to this , I wish I am going to sail : I have never try it , but it seems to be great !
Finally , I have two questions more : I wonder if I can change my french money in the Camp and what kind of clothes I have to buy before coming ?
Yours sincerely .
Didier Bovie
Dear Kim ,
As you asked me in your last letter , I am going to tell you more about the last month 's pop concert .
Firstly , I arrived five hours before the begining of the concert in order to help the musicians to move the material from the van to the scene .
As soon as all the conections was made , we tested the nivel of the sound : I found it too loud , so I advised them to regular it , and they listed to me !
Then , there was only one hour left to install the differents color lights : it was just enought time .
Thus , it was a fantastic afternoon because I like very much music , even if I do n't play any music instrument .
Moreover , I learnt a lot about music , especially concerning the way of using an instrument .
Consequently , I hope I will play an instrument in the future , especially because the group promises me to help me to learn any instrument .
See you soon .
Best wishes
Didier Bovie
Dear Mr Robertson ,
On behalf of my class , I am writing to request few changes in our London programme which has already been planned .
My friends have seen an advertisement which is the London fashion and leissure show .
it will be held on 14th March .
We have decided it would be more interesting to see the latest fashions , make up , hairstyles instead of going to do shopping .
We would suggest gong to this fabolous show .
it is also free of charge for students .
We will be given a great opportunity to have fun and look around in London .
We would all thank you for the organised programme .
I apologise any inconvenience that this cause you . We would be pleased if you could make a new arrangement in your programme
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours Sincererly ,
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE NEW YOUR HOUSE ?
We spend most of our life in our houses .
We like them show our life style and of course feel ourself comfortable .
I can imagine in the future how it would be ?
It would be much technological or far less complex . it could be as simple as we think .
but the imagine of the life style depends on person .
On the other hand , it would not be changed .
Somehow I could say that the main appliance would remain the same working structure .
Despite being used in many ways , it could entartian us as well .
On balance I would accept whatever could make my life easier . to live .
I would n't mind having things talking to around me . it would be enjoyable to have virtual friends in my house .
Although I imagine my house in my future , I am sure I would be suprised when I had them .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I 'm writing to complain about the musical show which I 've recently seen at your theatre .
I was enthusiastic about the special event .
The advertisement shew two actors but I was surprised to see as the main caracter a different person .
As well as this , to my horror , the performance did n't start at 19.30 but forthy five minutes later .
In addition to this , the theatre restaurant was closed for lack of servants .
No discounts were available !
So , I 'm sure you will understand why I 'm feeling so annoyed by the whole incident . I hope you will give me back the prize of my ticket !
I look forward to hearing from you in the near future .
Yours faithfully ,
Introduction : It seems to me that modern technology has deeply changed our daily life .
The computer is everywhere and it 's available for everyone .
An usefull help : The personal computer can fastly help you in lots of situations .
Moreover , a variety of micro computers are now everywhere such as in your car , on your radio and so on .
Have a good feeling with it ! :
On one side , the modern technology is extremely important , on the other hand you should n't abuse of it .
Conclusion : I do think , however , the modern technology is essential for human being nowadays .
Although the world of computers will develop day by day , I lively hope we ( human being ) could mantain our personality of seeing things .

Dear Sir or Madam ,
I have recently been to the Circle Theatre to see a musical show .
It was advertised as London 's Newest and best musical show .
However , it had been a very dissappointing evening for me .
Firstly , it was mentioned that there were going to be two starrings but , in fact , only an actor were performing on the show .
Secondly , there was a delay on the show which supposed to started at 19.30 but , it was actually started at 20:15 .
This really upset me as no notice were given before the show .
Thirdly , the advertisment said that the discounts were avaliable but , the ticket seller said that there was no discount allowing or avaliable .
In addition , the advertisment mentioned that restaurant will be opened after the show but it was closed because , short of cooker .
Finally , I would like to ask for money back for the ticket due to the disapointing evening out and unreliable advertisement you have created .
I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible .
Yours faithfully ,
Cook Phatosub .
Nowaday , modern technology is becomming very essential to our daily life .
As it is another important factor which affects our life , apart from money , health , food and house .
The reasons it is important to us are , first of all , if you think bout life without computers , communication machines and transportation machines .
We would n't be able to sort out informations and datas this quickly .
Secondly , no one could communicate on the phone through countries or even through houses as immediate as nowadays .
Lastly , it would take people months and months to travel to the other side of the world and also the journey would be much more dangerous than travel by plane .
Without all this you life would definately change back to the same position as it were 50 or more years ago .
Put it in another words , modern technology has changed our life to became more advanced in every ways .
On the other hand , the affects that it has on our daily life is not always good as sometime , the technology went wrong and out of hand of people who control it can cause disaster accidents , for example : plane crashes , trains crashed and explosion of nuclears bomb .
If this continue to happen our life would be very misarable as accident happens all the time .
Therefore , it is important to get it exactly right .
Dear Mr Robertson
I am writing on behalf my English class .
We have just known the programme you prepared for our three - day trip to London .
Thank you very much for many interesting positions in this schedule , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which , we are shure , will be very exciting .
I would like to inform you , that we have seen an advertisement for the " London Fashion and Laisure Show " and we have found it very interesting .
There will a lot of show for instance latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles .
I would like to say that it is very important for us to be there and it could be great opportunity , because the entrance is free for students .
The even is planned on 14th of March between 10.00 am and 19.00 p.m. If it is possible we would like to ask you to change your programme .
We will be able to visit the Science Museum on Wednesday 's afternoon .
We have checked that it is open every day .
As you know we are the best students in our school and it would be nice prize for our work during this year .
I would b grateful if you consider our suggestions .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Your sincerelly
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
It was night and I was alone in my house .
Suddenly I heard a noice from my garden and I wanted to know what it was , but it was impossible to do it .
The outside lights were broken down and I could n't see anything .
My dog was very angry .
I was affraid that someone was near my house and wanted to get to my house .
After a few minutes I heard steps near my kitchen 's window .
I was very frethend , but I knew , that I should do something .
I had no time to call someone and I had to go to my kitchen to check what it was .
I stood against the window and I started to listen .
I was shure there were someone on the other side of the wall .
It was terrible , I thought that it was the last day of my life .
Suddenly someone broke my window .
I had no time to think , I kept one of the pots and hit him in his head .
One moment later I called police .
He was a thief , who were looked for for many years .
17th June 2000
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am just coming back from a week 's holiday in London , which has been all in all really nice .
The only thing which really disapointed me was a visit in your theatre where I wanted to see the musical ' over the rainbow ' , after I read the advertisement for the show .
The things that really dissapointed me were that you said Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were suposed to be the actors but they were n't , different actors played and to be honest they made the hole show very bad .
Also the show was supposed to start at 19.30 but finally it started at 20.15 and that is such a waste of others people time .
Another thing was that you said discounts are available which is very important for students , but no their were n't any .
Also after the show your restaurant was closed because their was n't enough staff .
To be honest that was not a great expierence and I hope you will see my point .
In that case I also want to ask you for my money back .
I think you will understand that and looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully
T. Herschel
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
Since everyone can afford modern technology the life of everyone in the more developed countries has changed completly .
We ca n't imagine to live without it anymore because we are so dependent of it .
It starts already in the morning that we wake up by the sound of an alarm clock , than in the bathroom we have running hot water and also the hole house is warm due to central heating .
Then we can just go to the fridge where all the fresh food is stored ready to eat .
If we than want to go to work we do n't have to get our horse , no , we get the car keys and go where ever we want to .
At work we have the most important thing in the world of technology , the computer .
Without that we ca n't do anything today .
So in the last century our daily life changed dramandesly and we became lazy and our life unpersonal , fast and unromantic .
Noone can think about a life without commuters or electricity .
But we ca n't say the new technology has done just bad things in our life because otherwise we could n't have made such progress in all the sciences and other subjects
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to express my annoyance at your musical show which happened to be inaccurate at the leaflet given .
Your advertisement mentioned that the famous Danny Brook would play in this show but disappointingly it was another , unkown actor who starred instead of him .
Another point which caused some inconveniences was the timetable of the show .
It began 45 minutes later than it should have been .
Notwithstanding the fact that I could have expected a discount for my ticket , it occuried to be impossible to have one .
Although your leaflet suggested that your theatre restaurant would be open it was not the case because of a lack of available staff .
All those innacuracies spoilt what should have been a memoriable evening so I would like to be refunded at least for the price of my ticket .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
T. Gens
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Of course , it was my fault . I should have known better but I had to tell it to someone .
It was far too heavy to keep it for myself .
So I made a mistake and I told her .
The day after , at school , I noticed that everyone was looking at me .
I immediately knew that something was wrong so I had a word with Pat .
She denied having revealed my secret but she was averting my eyes .
From this moment , I knew without the shadow of a doubt that my mother would know it sooner or later .
It was only a question of hours before my life would collapse .
I tried to take it on my stride but I could n't .
I was terrified .
My fear turned out to be right .
I read the hurt in her eyes .
She knew .
She knew that I had bought my first bra without having asked her for advice before it .
17 - 6 - 00 .
Mr. Smith ,
I write to you because last night , ( Saturday 10 ) , I went to see the musical show that you are presenting at the Circle theatre .
I am a great fan of Danny Brook and went to see him in his new show , but , to my surprise , it was n't him who played that night but another horrible young actor .
I went with my daughter , a university student , and she was supposed to have a discount on the ticket .
We asked for it and we were told that there was not discount neither for her not for anyone else , so I had to pay the full price of the two tickets .
Furthermore , it was announced to start at 19.30 p.m. and it started at 20.15 p.m. for reasons anyone would explain to the audience .
After the play , we went to the theatre 's restaurant and we found out that it was closed since 1999 's spring !
How can you ask the people to go to a closed restaurant ?
In conclusion , I would be very grateful if you could send me my money back because , as you have seen , I did n't spend the " perfect evening " you announce .
Yours sincerely ,
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Although he had promised Lise that he would n't say a word , when he reached the school he told the secret to Ann .
Of course , Ann promised not to tell anyone , but by the lunch - break all the school knew that Lise had stolen the literature exams .
Very soon , Lise understood that it was useless to continue pretending that she knew nothing about it , and decided to make a deal with her class mates .
She would give them the exam 's questions and they would make all her homeworks during 3 weeks .
There was no escape .
It was an unfair deal , but if they wanted the questions they had to accept , and if they accepted , they could n't tell anything to the teachers , because , in fact , they were as guilty as Lise .
Unfortunately , the perfect plan does n't exist , and a teacher heard two students talking in the bathroom .
The teachers started investigating and asking all the students , but it was a secret and they could n't say a word .
Finally , the teachers asked Lise and her friends .
No - one said a word .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .

Jane Clark , organizer
Dear Madam ,
I 'm writing this letter to congratulate you for the excellent international arts festival we could enjoy last November .
I found it was a very good idea .
However , there are a few things that I personally think can be improved in the following editions .
First of all , because of the advertisement I expected starts and artists from all over the world but they came from only six countries .
Artists from different cultures may make the festival even more interesting .
Secondly , although the music concerts were good , I think that some concert halls were too small .
It was a shame to found that some of them were sold out because the short number of seats available .
However , I really enjoyed the dance shows and the plays and films .
I suggest it can be a good idea to set more projections next year .
Moreover , in my opinion two days is a short time for this kind of event , and I strongly encourage you to organise a full week festival .
Finally , the prize was reasonably and it was helpful to have one ticket for all the weekend .
I hope you 'll attend my suggestions .
Yours sincerely ,
Once upon a time , in a small Catalan village , there was a little boy who loved cheating and making jokes .
His father was a shelter , He had one hundred sheeps and one dog , and he used to take the animals to the mountain to feed them .
One day , he became ill and was worried about the animals .
His little son , called Joan , decided quickly : " I will help you . I will take care of the sheeps for you , father " .
the next day he went to the mountain with the animals .
At the beginning he was excited but soon he got bored . "
Let 's have a bit of fun " , he thought .
And then he started shouting : " the fox !
Help me ! the fox ! "
Some people went to help him , and then realised that it was not true .
They were angry .
He did it more times , and at last nobody cared of the shoutings .
One day , the fox attacked his animals and he shouted as much as he could .
Nobody came .
Then he learned to say always the truth .
Dear Mrs. Helen Ryan .
It was so great to hear that I had won first prize .
It would be meaningful in my life to take part in your camp .
I am writing to reply about your questions .
I am wondering that I will be only able to travel in July , because I have to finish my first year at the university .
It finishes 29th of June .
In addition to this , I have already resistered another course which starts from 2nd of August .
Secondly , I would prefer living in tents , I always admire outdoors life .
Finally , I would like to surging and golf .
In case of surfing , I have never had an experience , I am absolutely beginner .
On the other hand , I used to play golf with my father .
When I was 14 , I won the competition .
I would like to ask about Camp California .
Let me know if I have to take which kind of clothes and how much money I need .
It would be very helpful .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Your sincerely
Hi .
How are you ?
I am fine .
Thanks for your letter .
I want to let you know about my experience as you wanted .
Well , last month , I worked at a pop concert .
It was fantastic because I could see Madonna .
My main job was to tide up her dressing room .
Can you imagine ?
You are working with your idea woman , I ca n't still belive that I spoke with her .
Anyway , the most important thing was that I had good experience .
If we had worked together we would have had a good time .
It 's pity , is n't it ?
Now , I know how difficult to sing in front of the audience and behind the start there are a lot of the people who help the performance .
Next time , I hope that we 'll work together .
Let 's find some information to get a job .
Shall we ?
I have to go now .
I am fed up with studying , but I have to .
I hope that you 'll be alright .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
With lots of love ,
I 'm so happy that I 've won 2 weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
At first I could n't belive that I was a winer
I would like to travel at the Camp in July , if is possible .
This is just one months which I 've fee .
I 'm a student .
My school starsts in September and it finishes in June .
July is months when I 'm having a rest and I 'm doing nothing .
In August I 'm working in the shop which is my sister .
If I could go in July would be greate .
I can sleep in tent , it would remain me a good time which I 'd spent with my friends a few years ago . I 'm not scared of darkness , rain , cold or hot whether .
I 'm sure would be good fun ; sleep next to each other telling scared story .
Is good for make friends , you can know them better doing everything together .
Also I know that I have the chance to do two activities while I 'm at the Camp .
I would like to choose basketball .
This is sport which I , , love " .
I play basketball since I was 12 .
Some of my friends say that I 'm very good player , but I do n't think so .
Another sport which I 'd like to do is swimming .
In swimming I 'm not as good as in basketball , but I 'd like to practise more and maybe learn something new about it .
I would like to ask you , what sort of clothes shall I take with me ? I do n't want take too much ; jeans , jumper , swimming costium , T - shirt , sports shoes I think should b O.K.
Know , I can just wait for July
Hi Kim !
How are you ? I 'm fine .
I 'm so exited .
Last month I was helping at a pop concert with a few friends of mine .
It was Tina Turner concert !
To this moment when I 'm thinking of it I want shout .
At first I was helping to seill the tickets - was n't difficult .
Anyway , four hours , before concert had started , I was helping with lights .
We had to check evey plug , switch , lights .
I could n't belive how big the lamp can be .
That 's why singers are hot .
When concert had started and Tina cam out I forget about lights , just I was looking at her .
fortunetly nothing had happend .
Every - thing was O.K
After concert we were invited in backstage . then I could see her very , very clear .
Just people who was helping and organizating this concert could meet her .
Some of them were speaking with her , I was n't this lucky person , but still I 'm happy , that I could be thear .
Dear Madam
I am writing to answer the informations that you need from me .
First I would like to thank you for doing this competition and I would also like to thank you for the prize .
Answering your questions , I would like to travel only en July because this is the month of my vacations .
In July I will be free to travel anywhere I please .
According to your letter I have two options of accommodation , or in tents or log cabins .
I would prefer in tents because I think that is something more exciting and new for me .
I never stayed in tents in the middle of nowhere , in my life so I would prefer something more realistic and new .
Log cabins may be more confortable , on the other hand I think that I will be able to " survive " in tents .
Looking to your letter , I can see many options of activities and I realized that I like most of them .
I think I would prefer Climbing and Painting .
The reason of choosing this two activities is that they contrast itselves , I want one more exciting and that asks for more agility and another more calm and relaxing , that asks only for my ability to paint .
Climbing is something new for me and I am not so good on that , however I wish that I can learn about it on the Camp .
Painting is something that I love and I am very good doing it .
I have some doubts about my prize and travel .
Is there a possibility that you send me a list of material and clothes that I have to take ?
Is all the travel already paid including food and meals , or I have to bring some money ?
Do I have to bring something especial for the tents and camping ?
Please answer my letter as soon as is possible .
Your faithfully ,
GUSTAV SOARES .
Dear Kim ,
How are you ?
Is everything good in USA ?
I 'm writing to you because I had a wonderful experience last month .
There was a concert of a famous band here in my city .
I vish you were here with me .
So , I went with my friend to the concert with a lot of fans .
We bought tickets to the show and also to the fan 's bus .
Yes , there is a bus that take you to the concert and bring you back .
The concert was going to start at 22:00 and the bus arrived at my house at 18:00 .
When we entered inside of it , we saw a lot of fans using T - shirts , caps and shouting , " Almendegos , Almendegos ... " ( that is the name of the band ) .
AT 20:00 , we stopped in a coffee house to eat .
The shouted : " 20:30 you all have to be back because the bus will leave . "
We sat and started to eat and talk .
Suddenly a man came and started to tell us his adventures .
They were very interesting and we liked him so much .
After a few minutes ( I fought were few ) I realized that the coffee house was empty .
I looked to my watch : 20:45 .
The bus had left about fifteen minutes .
The man offered a ride .
We accept .
You can not imagine how dissapointed I were with my ownself .
When we arrived the concert had already began .
When we were running to enter a man called us .
He was helping to put the materials of the concerts ( microphone ... ) on the stage .
He asked if we could help .
We answered : " Yes ! "
We started to put everthing on the stage and after this we realized that the band was entering into the stage near us .
By my side the vocal of the Almendegos was and he touched my arm .
I will never wash my arm again .
After all of this we saw the show in the best place , near of the stage and after , the thing that I most liked , we were convidated to see the group and had their signatures .
That was the best night of my life .
I wish that you liked my experience .
Kisses ,
GUSTAV .
Dear Sir :
How are you ? I have been the musical show " over the rainbow " in your theatre last week .
I have got a few things to complain about your theart .
The first thing is in your note says that you should have got Danny Brook in the show .
But in the show , there was a another actor .
I was so disappointing , because I came far away to see Danny Broke .
In the note also says that the show start at 19:30 , and so I went in at 19:25 .
The show was started at 20:15 , which means it has wasted one hour of my time .
Note says that tickets has discounts available , but I bought my ticket and your people told me that there is not any discount for thicket .
When the show is finished .
I deciced to go and visit your theatre restaurant ,
But I went there and it is closed for some reasons .
I was really hungry and I went to other restaurant as soon as I can .
The note says that your perfect evening out , I thought I could get my money back , with your poor service and all my reasons , But it was not ask for money back .
I was really disappointed about your threat and service , I hope I can get my money back and you can improve it . Than you for reading .
Today , science and technology help us a lot .
For example .
In the pass , people have to go and get wood , make a fire and cook , but now people can cook in a microwave and do not have to do all the hard work .
Science and technology can give us a better live style or better food .
For example , before people have to walk from a place to the other , but now we can use sciene and technology to produce a lot of petrel transport and we can transport with them faster .
We also can produce more and better food or using science and technology . e.g. use science to put all the good part of two plants into one plant .
We can also use techlogy to produce more food and help them grow faster .
Science and technology can also used for some material e.g. steel or iron , which use for our building , it can make it stronger and not easy to destroy .
Science and technology can give us a lot of good thing for our daily life , make us easy to do thing or work .
Dear Jane ,
I have read the advertisement for the festival and I must say it is a great idea .
I would like to tell you some suggestions .
The stars and artist are from only six countries , and some concerts take place in small halls .
I think you should put it in the advertisement .
Are there going to be more plays and films next year ?
I find the reasonably - priced ticket excellent , because there is a lot of people who went to see only one or two events , and by paying the all events ticket they might see other events and learn about something they did n't expected to find interesting .
I would like you to answer my letter .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you ,
Dear John ,
Here in Brazil the rules at school depends on the school .
In general , the rules at private schools are much harder than the ones at state schools .
In mine , we did n't have many rules .
For example , nobody said anything when we smoked in the garden or in the bathroom .
We were allowed to go out if we did n't want to stay in class .
But we had to use the uniform and we had to study a lot to pass the exams .
the rules at home are very different . I am allowed to do what I want as long as I studie enough to aprove .
I think that my parents let me do what I want , because they trust me . they know that if I go out with the car , I will not drink .
It is not allways easy , but there are rules in every home and you have to respect them .
I am looking forward to hearing from you ,
Dear Sir ,
I have come to watch the musical show called ' Over The Rainbow ' in the Circle Theatre .
I was really disappointed because a lot of things were not done .
I will explain these now and want to ask to get some of the money I have given you back .
It was written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were starring in the show .
Danny Brook was not there , a different actor was in his place .
That was very disappointing for me .
The musical show was going to start at 19.30 , but it started t 20:15 .
We have waited for 45 minutes getting bored for it to start !
When I went to buy tickets , they did n't accept the discounts .
But I had read that the discounts were available .
Like it was written again , we went to visit the theatre restaurant after the show , but it was closed .
They said that the time was late and they wanted to go home .
There was nothing for us to do , the show started 45 minutes later .
Now , I think that you have seen it was not a perfect evening at all , a lot of things written were not done So I am asking to get some of my money back .
Yours faithfully ,
DAILY LIFE - MODERN TECHNOLOGY
MY daily life . I get up early in the morning , go to school , then come home and do what I would like to do .
I go shopping , watch TV , walk around the city , use my computer and get lost in Internet . etc .
Modern technology is everywhere in my life .
I do n't see it in a normal day , but when I sit and think , its everywhere !
For example , I get up whenever I want using my watch or clock .
It 's not a good example for modern technology , but it 's a piece of technology at last !
TV was black and white at first and there were only two or three channels .
Now it 's colourful and there are many channels on TV .
You watch whichever you want .
I ca n't think that I watch the same channels every day .
A wonderful example for modern technology : Computer !
It is not a living thing but it has a brain .
It knows more than most of the people .
And Internet . You can look for everything you want .
You can talk to every people living all around the world .
You do n't understand the time passing when you are in that world .
You can have information about all the things , go everywhere .
Everything is near you .
You can reach them whenever you want !
You see , our daily life consists of modern technology .
It would be hard to live without it .
Dear Ms Helen Ryan ,
I have just received a letter from you and I am really happy to hear the news that I have won first prize in the competition .
I would like to tell you something about what you asked me in the letter .
Firstly , I can travel only in July because I have no time except July as I am a postgraduate student . I would very much like to stay in a log cabin .
I think it is a wonderful idea to stay in a tent only for few days but not over 3 days .
It will be more comfortable to stay in a log cabin .
Regarding with two activities I will choose swimming and photography .
I am not good at swimming but I would very much like to learn how to swim this year .
On the other hand , I am very good at photography as I was a photographer in a club while I was in the college .
Lastly I would particularly like to know about clothes and money .
Is n't it cold at night in the Camp California ?
I like ice cram , sweets and beverage very much especially in the summer .
Are these expensive ?
Could you please tell me about these ?
I am looking forward to your reply .
Yours sincerely ,
Shin Parade
Do you think shopping is always enjoyable ?
Well , it might be true but I think it depends on the situation .
When you do shopping , you can see various products even very extraordinary thing .
You can also see more graceful and fine thing .
You usually visit many shops and compare the quality and the price and select the best one which suits to you .
On the other hand , it usually take much time to get what you exactly want .
Because you have to visit many shops and see many thing .
If shopping mall is not collected , it is physically hard to get what you want .
It 's not easy to shop with someone who are not interested in shopping .
In conclusion , shopping is not always enjoyable as many people think .
It depends on the situation .
It even varys with people whom you shop with .
London , June 17th
Dear Sir ,
I 'm writing to you to make complaints for the very disappointing evening I had at the Circle Theatre .
Firstly , I found that there were no discounts as it was announced in the advertisement .
Then , I not only had to wait 45 minutes more than it was expected for the beginning of the show but I realised that the main actor had been replaced by another one ( very bad ) as well .
Of course I must tell you that the strongest reason for my going to see the show was Danny Brook 's presence .
Finally , after the show , I went to the theatre restaurant just to find that it was closed and the friend I had asked to meet me there was not waiting for me .
As if that was not enough he thought I had been kidding , inviting him to a closed restaurant where I did n't appear .
Those were the reasons for my asking a refund of the £ 20 I paid .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
yours faithfully
Every day we find out new devices that promise us to satisfy our needs .
I usually do n't buy a lot of them but I must recognise that some of them are useful .
I ca n't remember waking up with the alarm - clock , making a hand - made orange juice or heating water for the coffee .
Therefore , I have more spare time to enjoy the one I consider as the most important influence technology had in my life : the computer and Internet .
The improvement of electronics and global communications has made it possible to know places , look for information or even keep close contact with friends all over the world .
Now , I will never say again that I do n't know where can I find some information about this or that and when on holidays or every time I make a new friend , I just ask for the email and that 's enough to know we will know about each other soon .
Dear Mr Robertson
I am writing in the name of the whole class .
First of al , I want to thank you for the interesting programme , which you already have organised .
It is very good , especially the Sightseeing tour by bus .
However , we have seen an advertisement in yesterday 's newspaper for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
It takes place on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 at Central Exhibition Hall in London .
There we can see everything about the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles .
The entrance for student is free .
This is a great opportunity because as you know most people of our class are going to work in this sector so it will be very interesting for everybody and also a kind of education .
Instead of going to the Science Museum on Tuesday morning we thought we could postpone it to Wednesday afternoon .
The shopping could be done after the river trip to Greenwich but only if we have enough time .
I hope you will agree with our suggestion and if you have any further questions do not hesistate to contact me .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours sincerely
Will the home of the future really look different ?
It 's quite difficult to say , but of course there will be a change .
For example if you look back into the forties and compare the home with nowadays you can see that it has become more modern , especially the facilities in the kitchen and in the livingroom .
in the future it could be that you do n't have to prepare your breakfast by your own , perhaps you just have to press a button when your alarm clock has gone .
In addition to this you may have some roboters bringing the newspaper at the table , tidying up the house , doing the shopping and maybe they are also your living patners .
The place to spend the night will still be the bed .
The livingroom wo n't get any big changes although the televisions , stereos and videos will become more modern and perhaps more difficult .
In general we can say the huge change we already had , but who knows exactly what the future will bring to us ?
Let 's have a surprise ?
Dear Mrs. Ryan
Thank you for your letter which I have just received this morning .
I am really appreciated to hear that I have won first prize in the competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I am writing this letter to inform you more information about myself .
I would like to travel only in July because I will have a summer holiday for 2 months at that time .
I would prefer the accommodation at Camp California in tents because it would be nice to spend the time living in tents with a nice environment and fresh air .
Also I would like to do two activities while I am at the Camp which are swimming and photography .
Photography is quite interesting for me to take a photograph in the place where I have never been to .
Swimming is quite nice activity to relax and work out .
It is really enjoyable to keep my body fit and healthy by swimming .
Anyway , I would like to know that how many people are joining at this Camp .
Could you please tell me about the clothes I should take ?
I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible .
Yours sincerely
Boonsri Thanasukolwit .
Dear Kim
Thanks for your last letter .
I 'm really sorry , it 's taken me so long to reply .
How are you doing ?
I hope that you can get on well with your roommate .
Anyway , I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month .
I and my friend - Emma , we helped to paint the scence of the background on the stage .
As you known , I like drawing and painting when I have a free time so that why I chose to paint the scence of the background .
I really enjoyed painting it and it looked very nice .
And I particularly liked the experience that I helped to screen and paint a picture of " Bon Jovi " on every T - shirts which are given to the audiences .
I felt that it was a great time in my life .
However , I told my teacher that I am willing to give a hand next time .
Are you willing to give a hand next time ?
If you are , I 'll tell you in advance .
I must stop writing now as I have a lot of homework to do .
Best wishes
Dear Sir or Madam ,
Ref : Over the rainbow musical show .
I am writing to you to mention some problems about the musical show shown in your theatre .
First of all , it was supposed to be starring Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but in a real show , it was n't .
Because I 'm big fan of them , if was pretty much boring without them and not to mention that it was disappointing .
It did n't start at 19:30 and there was a delay for 45 minutes which was quite a long time and everyone got frustrated .
The tickets also caused a problem .
Discounts were n't available at all .
Moreover the testament was till under the construction so that we could n't use it when we were extlemely hungry .
Finally , I wonder why you did n't ask for the money back if you have guaranteed the perfect evening .
I am therefore writing to you to ask for the money back as I did n't get any advantages or services from you .
I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible .
Yours faithfully ,
L. P. Lou
Technology has been developed extremely fast these days and as it is still going on , it ca n't help affecting our lives .
One of the biggist thing has changed is a change in a method of communications .
People have invented such things like TV , radio , telephones and so on which made us enable to hear the news quickly and stay in touch with people easily .
There are also changes in biological areas .
Nearly almost of the disease have been found the way to cure except only a few like AIDS .
It helped us to live longer and make us stronger against them .
I have mentioned few changes above but there 's still a biggist one left which is about computer areas .
It helped us to be able to work much more quicker and accurately than before with the help of Internet .
Basically modern technology has changed our life more comfortably but there are some disadvantages such as lack of friendship , togetherness because of people staying in their house being on the Internet for whole day .
But we still have to admit that we ca n't live without them even they give us some disadvantages .
Dear Ms Ryan ,
Thank you for your letter .
I was pleasantly surprised that I have won the first prize in your competition .
Firstly , I would like to answer your questions .
As I am doing my A - levels exams at the moment and they continue until the 30th of June and my further studies start in August , I can only travel in July .
I would prefer to stay in a tent .
It will give me an adventure feeling and I have always prefered tents to log cabins .
I enjoy basketball very much and I am quite good at it .
I would like to play this game at your camp .
I have never tried out climbing , but I have always wished to do it one day .
Would it be possible to do this activity at your camp as a beginner ?
Secondly , I would like to ask you for some information .
Would you be kind enough to tell me which kind of clothes I should bring with me ?
Could you possibly tell me how much money I might spend at California Camp ?
Would you recommend me to bring some equipment , like a rope , sticks , with me ?
Thank you in advance for your help .
I look forward to receiving your prompt reply .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Kim ,
Hi , how are you ?
I 'm actually fine at the moment , but have to study a lot because of my exams in English .
You asked me to wite about my experience which I made by helping at the pop - concert .
It 's difficult answer at the question " what are you going to do in the future ? " if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher .. I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that the public transport will always be in the future .
The rich people will buy a car but the poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider that is more convenient to drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask to you something to be friends and change your telephone number .
In my experience when I did n't have a car I used to use the bus to go to the school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , the car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street , in that moment you realized the importance of a public transport .
In India we have various types of Public transport , like Cycle , Bike , Car , Train & Flight .
Depending on the distance and duration to the desired place , mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
But Generally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport .
This reminds me of a trip that I have recently been to and the place is Agra .
It takes around 6 hours by National highway to go from Delhi to Agra .
We have stopped at hotels for having food and just in case if any of us feels hungry , we have purchased some snacks just before the trip .
Since , we have the option to wait anytime we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by train & Flight ) .
In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short nap on the back seat and wake up fresh .
Due to the above mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sarah .
I am 17 years old .
I am looking forward to join you in this year summer camps .

In addition to that , i enjoy cooking .
My family think that my cook is amazing .
I hope that you give my the chance to join you .
Thanks
My favourite sport is volleyball because I love plays with my friends .
Volleyball is a sport play every place , when I travel on the beach I like plays with my sister in the sand and after we are going to the sea .
It is very funny .
when I was young I like plays with the ball in the playground and my friend and I played using the soccer goals as a network of volleyball .
Dear Jo ,
How are you ? I 'm writing to inform you that some advice on travelling and working in my country .
On the one hand , in my country there are a lot of place to travel .
For example Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , Valencia .
There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit for example in Madrid you can visit " Puerta del Sol " , " Las Cibeles " .
I visit Madrid twice a year .
All summer I visit Sevilla because I love this city and I suggest that you visit Sevilla .
On the other hand , in my country there are a few job because the economy is very bad .
But , if you want I look for a job from you .
My best friend looking for a people responsible for look after her sister .
Her sister is 6 years old and you should look after every weekend .
You will be interesting in this job ?
Thank you for you e - mail , it was wonderful to hear from you .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you .
Take care , Laura .
Today public transport still play an important role in transport system and it will keep on in the future .
Because public transport is a cost effective and better resource allocation in mass transport system .
Also people need not to suffer high operating cost running their own car .
But it can use a cheaper way going to their destination especially it is far away from home .
For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane travelling to another country .
Instead it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on public plane .
In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that does n't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport continue to have future but people are going to use more the cars then bus or underground .
If we think about it the car is better because we do n't need to wait for them has we are waiting for the bus or underground but in another way car cust more money than the public transport .
By car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unkwoned but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both trasnportations are good and the cars do n't need necessarialy to end up with the public transport .
If I had it to choose between both transportation I think I probably chose car because it is better for me to go by car then to go by bus .
In my community , we are very interested at environment and ecological things .
We have solar panels and a place to make compost at the last garden , with worms who eat and degrade all the organic waste of the school .
In some strategic points of the building we have special trashcans to separate the garbage in organic , paper and cardboard , cans and pet bottles and they also made talks and presentations about the earth problems like global warming , contamination , etc .
The manager of all this project is Miss June Sid , our science teacher .
All this initiatives has made us all over the years a recognised ecological community .
Good morning everyone , today I want to share about is my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football , why I choose it?Well , football is a international sport , people around the world will love it so much!Example like Barclay Premier League , Liga Premier , Fifa World Cup and so on .
I believe that 's all will delighted us .
By the way , my favorite football team is Manchester United , they are brilliant , they have an amazing football players , and they are awesome .
Michael was a little kid when he had a dream that was : Be a super hero !
After many years he still dream to become a super hero .
He enter the university of medicine because he thinks that this profession was the more similar to be a super hero .
Pass some years of the university and he know a girl called Kate and he get loved on here and she get loved in him .
Kate was cursing the university of fashion .
Then the two started to date .
Michael and Kate was so happy , until one day that Michael said to him dream to be a super hero , Kate get so nervous saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid dream and that Michael was only dreaming but that would never happen and that super hero do n't exist .
When she said that , Michael started to cry and get mad saying that she was lying and do n't have heart .
He got so mad that he asked her to get out of his apartment .
In following day , she said sorry and them was happy again .
But when them get to the home of Michael they fight again and Michael get a knife and kill her .
He cried with a lot blood around .
Michael get away from there .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Public transportation is an important invention in human history , it brings amount of benefits in our life .
For instance , we take subway in order to avoid stocking in traffic .
It is true that moving by car is more convenient than take public transportation , however , it would cause more damage to our life and harm our environment .
Therefore , we need to think more about our future , our offsprings .
Giving them a safe , clean and comfortable place to live .
If there is no public transportation , traffic jam will be serious than before .
In my country , taipei , we always stock in traffic for about one hour in the morning .
I can not imagine if there is no bus or MRT , how long I will take for school .
Car is convenient for human , but it brings damage for human also .
For example , carbon dioxide which is created by car .
It cause global warming which threats our environment and harms our daily life .
we can see that there are lots of serious and frequently weather disaster happened in decades , such as typhoon , hurricane , wild fire and mud slide .
What other precautions , is usually taken ?
The NG Office is notified by the photographer when the film was shipped .
Lost shipments have been found more easily when this process will be started right away
The pleasure of traveling
People go , people come .
Every day lots of people are travelling abroad but , what 's the best way to do an international travel ?
The most important option to travel is , by far , the plane .
But , even when it 's true that it 's the faster option , you must be very carefuly at time to get off a plane .
If you are looking for confort and relax , obviously , you have to take a boat .
There are a wide variety of things to do and enjoy the trip .
Although , the better option , is pick out a train .
There is n't comparation on watching the changes in the landscape through a window , enjoying the way that you are doing and , the best part , the cheapest way to get away some days and take the routine off some days .
Anyway , no matter how you go , no matter where you go .
The pleasure of travelling is travel at all .
Transportation one of the most important thing on life so we have many of kinds for transportation now we travel by car but in the near future it will be other comfort and easy ways to travel like fast train and plane that can transport you from north to south in less than hour this will make business men happy and comfort because of saving a lot of times and efforts so we hope that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible
In modern societies , there are lots of friends around our daily lives .
Big project could not be finished without co - operations .
Friends could be communicated and exchanged the ideas , feelings and funny things happened around ourselves .
More importantly , the parents give our lives and they touch us knowledge and skills or abilities to live in this world .
In this case , the families played important roles in daily lives .
The reasons are as follows .
First of all , we could learn lots of skills from parents according to their own experience .
For example , we could learn how to communicate with others in a friendly way , and we could also learn how to make a meal from parents .
Secondly , the families could give you some advice about how to deal with the things which will cause trouble .
If difficulties was told to the families , the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation .
All in all , in this case , the families are the most important friends in our lives .
The Computing Technology has been advancing very much this last years , making the old computers almost useless , getting better and making the difference between old and new computers grow even more with every new discoverement .
As we can notice , old and new computers are vastly different , starting from the size of the computers , old computers were much bigger than new computers .
Old computers were used to occupy one entire room , now , they only have the size of a box , even the size of a book .
You can have a portable computer now , and take it with you to every place you visit .
Old computers only let you make math tasks , or even play simple games with 2 colors ( green and black ) , but now you can do whatever you want to do , like creating or playing videogames , writing or reading a book , connect to the internet , watch or make videos , invent new stuff to improve the Computing Technology , and not only in 2 colors , but thousand of them .
One of the greatest achievements of new computing , is the internet , where you can connect to other computers , download stuff , etc . via Ethernet cable or Wireless Connection ( Wi - Fi ) .
I went to the abandon house and started to think the best way to make his life miserable i passed the next 2 weeks looking for ideas to make him sufer .
As i did n't found nothing , i went to the place he live at and started to look for some information about his life and found people who he care about so as i continued to go to his houes i notice he will alays go to tehe same house so i decidec to follow him to the house and i foun out he was dating a girl she might be his girlfrien so i finally gota an idea , i would drive him crazy just as he did with me , that way she will think he had problems on his mind and left him , but son i thougt about it again and realized that if i did that she will try to help him and they will be more united , so i decided to drive them both crazy almost at the border of death , jus as he did with me !
But wait a minute am i really so angry to make this ?
Yes !
I screamed , my anger had dominated my mind i did nt had no longer control over my actions , i was afarid of what i had become and what i could do , but i could not control my self and the only thing i could think of was him suffering with a slow death and the satisaction i would feel when i finally had my revange , the best revange .
But i was so mad at him and so ansiouns to make his life imposible , and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the sufering i had been throug became stronger and bigger , i had made a desition i was goingo to do it , if he dedicated 4 years of his life tourtoring me and not wanting me to be happy i would the time is nesesary for him to have a miserable life and i wo nt stop until i had acomplished my goald
I 'm not agree with this idea completely .
On the one hand travel by car are really much more convenient as give the chance to you to be independent .
On the other hand huge traffic jams are a big issue for travelling by car .

public transportation has been more used by people and over the years it is kind of becoming cheaper and also more safe but some people prefer cars to extent do we agree with and what is our reasons for that that is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay
before about 40 years there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those years there was not even good facility to move from place to other and that is because there was no companies to build cars in about 10 years cars trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans at the beginning the faced a lot of problems but they were able to solve it by the end
nowadays all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses even trains and planes .some people prefer cars because the do like crowded places or because the find it sometimes cheaper but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster but when it comes to traveling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy more by chilling out from crowded places
to summaries it is different from some oneis opinion to another i predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more that by the end cars will disappear and will will no longer be used
The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country .
This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture , scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years
Development of biodiesel industry can be a contribution to productivity growth .
A large scale of investment was bring for biofuel development .
Meanwhile , it boost economic growth and jobs opportunity , thereby enhance Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) .
If you are living in big town or small It does matter but one thing should be taking care by the people and organiser of the town , is environment .
Global warming is huge issue in today 's date .
Government should take immense action to stop it or at least make it slow down .
However we the people have really important part of making it worse .
Active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh , clean and safe environment to their people .
Recycling item can be a good step to start with clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taking care by my city .
Everyone have to plant a tree in front of their home with the rule of province government .
People is not realizing that cutting the tree can reduce the production of oxygen in atmosphere .
Eventually human will have no more fresh air to breath .
Additionally , our city government has prohibited smoking in public area and under 18 year old and provides a free session of talk or presentation to increase the awareness of clean , safe , fresh environment to the city .
In conclusion , I would suggest to our neighbour cities to taking part of cleaning environment so one day it can be seen in whole country .
Everybody has his favourite sport .
My favourite sport is football game .
On our school or villiage football stadium i spend a lot of time every day .
Usually i play football with my classmates .
Before training i ran 1 - 2 kilometres and my legs get a power and my body gets an energy .
Our team has a hard - working coach and he gives professional advice to us , how to improve football skills .
His main words:"You must work and work very hard , if you want to get high results " .
I can say , that coach is experienced person .
Not so long ago , we are had competition .
The first place was gotting by us .
We have achieved this result , because we are friendly and organised .
I believe , that in the future I will be a famous football player in teams such as Skhatar or Dynamo .
Football is my life .
I want to give advice to someone who starts this sport:"You must believe in yorself " .
Hallo my firend ,
What 's up ?

Dear Paul ,
I have seen your notice in the academy newspaper and I 'm quite interested . I have no plans for this summer so I think it is a good idea to spend it .
I was born in the UK so I can be a very good teacher of English .
Although I came to Spain ten years later so I can speak with them in Spanish if it was necessary .
Also , I assisted to a ballet course for 4 years when I was young .
It was a lot of time ago , however , I still keep the rhthym in my body !
By the way , I remember I had to create a dynamic training to do with the other ballet - course members . I had to be the teacher for one day and I did n't forget it because I felt wonderful .
All members congratulated me , as well .
On the other hand , I had taken care of my brothers and cousins for many hours when they were very young .
You must know that I 'm a very responsible , kind and funny person .
That makes me a good candidate to achieve the job , or the hobby for me !
I hope you keep in mind my candidature because I 'm not going to disappoint you .
Best wishes , Julia .
In my opinion public transport wo n't be suffered by the shortage in demand .
Because not everyone afford to buy their own car .
Besides there are lots of low income people who ca n't buy their own car .
So I think public transport 's future is bright .
What is the " Family " meaning ?
In my opinion , Family is the place that had you best friend can help each other and know each .
In the Taiwan , many of people have to take care of them parent when they get old , but the point is what if you can not survival , I mean you do n't have enough money to raise you parent .
Back to the topic , I do n't know well any of member of in my family , I do n't trust them , honestly .
I like NewZealand because there are many islands .
By the way , NewZealand have a cool weather .
In Malaysia , the weather is slightly warmer than there .
That 's why I order all of you to go there and feel the pleasure and have a try their own food .
You can also bought a lot of gifts like key chains , statue , or what else memories to be made before returning to Malaysia .
I did not have to go to NewZealand but believe me it is very beautiful place .
If I have sustenance , I will go there and bring all of you .
I live in Lentini , a small city in East Sicily .
The local Council hasn't a project for the environment .
People collect any kind of rubbish and throws all together in black sack .
Although the Council began to plan something , the people are n't committed with the problem .
Around the city , you can find many places where the people throw frigo , kitchen , " amianto " , old things or furniture .
What a pity !
The suburbs of Lentini could be wonderful .
There are orange trees , a large lake and Etna in background .
When I was a child , I had a lot friends and they were very important for me .
We ever played in the park or we talked about our tastes , music , boys , we laugh a lot of ...
But when I was a teenager I began to live situations that I did not like it , for instance , the girls said to me bad things or they talked bad about me .
In those years I lived the worst moments in my life .
I remember when I celebreted my 15th birthday , only one schoolmate wanted to come to my party ; I think that this day was one of the worst day of my life .
There night I cried because I felt that I have not got any friends .
However , my parents tried that my party was the best and they prepared for me a special birthday and they invited all my cousins and together went to eat pizza and gave me a lot of presents .
In there moment , I thought that my best friends was my parents and sister .
I knew that they never talk bad about me .
Now , my husband is my best friend .
He is the most important people of my life .
He has ever been with me .
Also , he is very funny and I laugh a lot with him .
Both like to travel around the world and to practise some sports , for example , tennis , running or trekking .
We like watching TV series and cooking several desserts too .
To sum up , my best friends are my family , especially , David , my husband .
Life of people around the globe is becoming busier and busier day by day .
A busy life always compell to use the fastest and most convenient mode of transportation , which has made public transportation system lag behind motor cars .

the tecnology have chanched the people 's life very much.in fact we can think how different is our life respect either to our parents or our grandparents life.for example my parents did n't whacth on tv , because there was n't any tv on the world when they were young.but it is n't the alone difference : we can think at the mobilefone , the computer ed at least the internet.our grandparents woundn't imagine a strange machine like computer in their life .
Although the fact that personal vehicle like car now is popular , in the future , the stance of public transport is still very crucial .
Nowaday , people use fossil fuel as the most important source of energy for travelling , manufacturing , this source of energy does n't always maintain at the constant level , but someday it will be run out .
People must find ways to use other energy sources like nuclear electricity , wind power , public transportation such as electric metro use this kind of energy .
As a result , governments will invest more in researching the usage of these new types of energy , travelling using public transport will become much cheaper than personal car .
The range of public services will be expanded to remote areas , it become much more convenient .
Commuting , travelling using public services will be the first prior choice .
In addition , the population is increasing rapidly , in the near future , almost cities in the world will become overcrowded , It will lead to many other problems to be solved , for example , traffic jams , air pollution .
In some perespectives , these problems are led by the over - using of personal vehicle .
People will realise that using their own car is just to waste their time for traffic jams or to gradually killing themselves for breathing polluted air .
So the best way for them to travel is public transpotations .
Each person should practice saving when using any source of eneny to protect his own live .
In conclusion , investments on developing public transport will be increased considerably , public services of travelling have a bright potential and it 's stance in the future ca n't be replaceble
Hello Alex , how are you .
Are you free for weckend , have you any plans .
Me and my friends go to the cinema , and I invite you to go with us .

Thank you Helen for those wonderful presents .
I always want to read these type of book .
I went to temple in the morning followed by lunch at the hotel latter in the evening went to the beach .
In conclusion it is evident that because developing countries are facing political and economic instability , migrants travel for better education prospects and stable environment for younger generation to grow up .
The effects of brain drain are that it creates a shortage of people qualified for professional jobs , economic stability is affected as a result of lack of people contributing to the economy .
The cause of Brain - drain should be tackled at international and national level on a broader dimensions and rational pattern , for it is a global issue .
In this situation , developing nations should take control of inflation ; focus on boosting up the infrastructure and law enforcement to support public in a positive manner .
There is n't too feww oxygen at the top of Everest to breathe easily
Jordan Romero has got 13 when he climbed Everest in May 2010 .
Mount Everest is so high that it is very difficult to climb .
the top was reached for the first time by two climbers in 1953 .
My friends and I , we like a programs of TV , electronic music , fashionable clothes . I prefer all .
Sometimes we are going to the party 's in the city , I am dancing in the party with my friends .
They listen to the music and can we are singing .
It 's very good .
Jason is my friend , he is drunk and also he dance with your girfriend .
Jose is the best song . he is singing and talking in the party .
Other person is Angel , he do n't dance in all place .
He prefer study in your home .
Hello Something .
My names is Steven and I 'm 14 years old . I 'm living in german .
In the moment I visit the Secondary modern school .
I 'm in grade 8 .
For example there are girl she is in my class she is beautiful .
I love her look .
Her eyes looks as the sun .
But she is ignored me .
I hope I can forget her .
Run for your life
My favourite sport is run .
I like to running fast so fast in fact that it feel me as if I run on air and the feet do not hardly touch the ground between the strides .
My favourite place to run is in the forest but I like to run sportive too .
I am likeing to feel the ground under my feet is soft so soft not the hard concrete of the footpaths in the city of the streets .
The bestest advice I can giving to someone who is starting the running is to starting slowly and not to try to run too fast but then to eventually build up the running week by week so that every week you are running a little more further and a little more faster and then after 20 years you will be an Olympic champion maybe .
In my opinion , television can be educational . Whether you are watching the news or a show about World War One .
Of course , it 's important to choose the right television shows .
If you 're watching Tom & Jerry , it hardly will have any educational value .
Although one could argue that you can always learn something .
A friend of mine recently explained that if a zombie apokalyspe should happen he would be prepared because he has been watching Walking Dead for some time now - so in his eyes , he learned how ( not ) to act in that case .
today I want to write about my job .
I 'm a forensic biologist and I deeply love my job .
It is a job with a lot of interesting aspects ,
It is dynamic , stimulating and , even if it is not well remunerated , I feel myself satisfied .
In the last few years forensic biology has developed many aspects like better sensibility , robustness of results and less time required for analyze a sample , but what struck me most is how fast this change happens .
Here there is one : do television offer highly likely opportunities for the audience in an educational way ?
From my experience knowledge , I believe television cover both entertaining and educational functions .
It notes how many educational programmes broaden young children 's horizons in the past few years , how quickly an adult learn different basics from a great deal number of educational programmes , such as cooking , science and technology .
Apart from eduational contents , there are so many foul contents , business advertisements and fake information on TV that citizens wo n't be able to tell right from wrong .
However , I believe the educational programmes on TV still plays a vital role in educating both adults and young children .
I think who the best restaurant where we can go is " the sailor 's restaurant "
Here we can eat typical Italian food .
The last time who I was here I have eat the best pizza that I have ever eat in my life .
The atmosphere remind the theme of the sea in fact the walls are decorating with a lot of shell and the waiters are dressed like sailors : I think that it 's a great idea !
Also , It 's perfect for our class because there is a lot of space so we can sit all together at the same table .
the owner is a very kind person and I 'm sure who he makes us a convenience price .
No future for public transport ?
Public transport is the cheaper way of travel , so it has future .
Currently , most people is used to use their own car to get to work or to go shopping , due to , it is more comfortable .
But cars pollute the air with CO2 emissions every day and contribute to the climate change .
So , if people were aware of this subject would n't use so much their own car .
In addition , having a car is very expensive .
First of all you need can afford to buy it , after that , you must pay for the asurance , council tax , and mechanic bills , and so on .
whereas in a public transport , you only have to pay the ticket , you do n't have to drive and if the bus or train or whatever vehicle you use , breacks down it is n't your responsibility .
Besides , public transport pollute less than cars .
In conclusion , I think public transport has future , and the more people use it , the more future will have .
I 'm your employee , to serve on your company .
Very pleased to be able to receive your salary payment .
But pay a little low .
I completed many tasks , including tutoring three students complete summer homework , correcting homework diligently assist the instructor , the instructor helped organize handouts , instead of the instructor to answer questions raised by the students , but also to clean the classroom hygiene , very hard , but I have nothing to complain about .
I work hard for two months , pay a lot .
Just your wage paid too much lower than I expected , I want a little higher wages , payment of 300 yuan more than the existing wage basis .
I invite you to consider the proposal .
I think about transport that the government has to help the public transport , for example bus , train , metro and more , for the only one reason : the quality of life against the pollution .
Travelling by car is more convenient in a lot of situation , but it could be annoying for search parking and for cost of fuel , and also maintenance cost .
In big cities public transport works well because there 's a good feedback by people .
Instead in the small cities , it ca n't be good in the same way , because for the transport companies it 's not convenient invest money , because fewer people would use it .
Tom Sawyer was a boy that lived with his aunt Polly and she had to punish Tom because sometimes Tom did n't go to school .
On Monday Tom went walking to school and he saw his friend Huck which they talk a lot and Tom exchanged a tick for his tooth .
Then he saw a beautiful girl named Becky so Tom talk to her at school and they went into a secret garden and Tom kissed Becky .
Tom say to her of another girl so she got mad and she ignored Tom .

The next day Huck went to Tom 's house to tell him that there is an abandoned house up the hill so the two boys considered like an andventure .
So they went to the misterious house and when they were inside they heard voices so Tom and Huck hide and they saw that Injuin Joe was the one that was talking .
the two boys heard that he was planing to steal some money and kill people so the boys start their adventure on stoping Injuin Joe ...
Hi , jo .
Thank you for your message .
I will do my best to answer your questions .
As for your questions , I think that you should work in Japanese restaurant , such as Japanese " ryotei " and " izakaya " .
That is because you will improve your Japanese skill in them .
Recently , many south East Asians have studied Japanese in Japan while working in them .
By improving their Japanese skills , in Japan they have the opportunity to get a job .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
He was at Sarah 's house when suddenly he left all the bathroom dirty and went to his house .
so he went back to Sarah 's house and clean all the bathroom , but Sarah already knew that he left the bathroom like this so before Michael entered to the bathroon she said : " I know what you leave there " and Michael went running to the bathroom .
Hi Julie ,
My school is located in the centre of the city in Bangalore , India .
My school has a unique reputation for their friendliness and the quality of education .
I like my maths teacher very much because her teaching style is very realistic and simple to understanad .
Good Morning :
This is an esay about my favourite sport , it is swimming since I was a child because always enjoy a lot and what is more I can do it alone , I never refuse to go swimming pool and less in summer , of course .
I do n't have friends who like swimming , almost like football or similar teams sports , and always I go alone it is n't boring for me furthermore , I prefer going alone because anybody bother me or I haven't wait anybody .
I said that because when I was eleven my best friend had been operated on her back and before the operation he came with me and every day I had to wait for her because she spendt a lot of time in the shower cleaning her long hais , I hated that !
Luckily the operation was fine and she left to come with me , and since that day I go for my own .
Swim is a relaxing exercise for me and normally there are n't many people in the pool , but sometimes there are children and I do n't like so much because they like disturbing me but sometimes it is amusing too .
I would recommended to people who not know swim to learn , because I am pretty sure that it like it and later they can stop swim .
I think that dance is a way for self - expression .
It 's not just a hobby , it 's more than this .
Dance is a passion , a type of life .
When I 'm dancing I forget all my problems , except my stupids companions that they do n't understand anything .
When you dance , sing , or act you are showing something to the public , something that 's important por you .
If dance is your passion , you practise every day , and you 'll keep practise all the days until you can .
If you are tired does n't matters , because you like that you 're doing .
You 'll wake up early for going dance , or do dance classes .
You do n't matter if you go to sleep late , or do n't sleep ...
That 's a joke , you must sleep .
If you love dance , you 'll understand me .
Members of my family .
i love my family special my little sister , she has sixteen years old , i consider my best friend because i used to tell her everything of my life .
i have a dog it name 's chente , it is a golden retriver .
It 's a lover dog , he knows how i feel .
My oldest sister her name cinthya , she is really weird with me .

Also i have a brother his name is jose luis he has twenty years old , his personality is dinamic and funny .
My mom and my dad , they are a goog guys .
Actually i prefer pass my time alone , i am working in other town so i stay away from my family .
Hi mrs .
Kate Ashby ,

For work in our cafe you have to speak English of course , maybe know how to cook some type of sweet foods like cupcakes , cake , cokiees or brownies , the most popular foods of this year .
Another thing that you must know it 's how to deal with people , we are searching for someone who can impress everyone , also someone who can bring the customers good atencion and service .

we think that in the future the planet will be in bad conditions and the trees will be dissappearing , after that we will be having wars .
In 30 years we will have changed our anatomy , also we will be eating fast food , on the other hand , the north pole will have melted totally .
The temperature will have become crazy by global warming , so some people will have died because the natural disasters will be more aggressive .
The Technology will have advanced and maybe the cars will be flying by streets and computers will have totally changed .
Because of this , we have to raise awareness of what is happening and we help the planet .
Friendship is something very important in my life .
I ca n't imagine my lifetime without friends .
How to make friends and meet new people ?
It is easyier than you think .
Just ... start talking !
Communication is the most important point when you 're going to make friends .
You have to remember , that friends are not supposed to agree on every single thing .
They just have to calm talk about it .
If your friendship is real , you will always find point between your opinion and your friend 's one .
Just try , it wo n't cost you much !
Good day ,
My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport , Volleyball one of the most beautiful sports ever and I used to practise this sport 3 times a week since 1980 , the reasons for my enjoyment with this sport are as follows :
1- make me fit and healthy
2- classy game no friction between players
3- it exercise all muscles of your body
Regarding the above I advice all rookies to start practise this sport and they will get many benefits .
However , the adults they can practise it as well and they will get the same .
As citizens of village , we totally care about environment of our village .
Every sunday , we do a mutual cooporation where anyone can treat rubbish as good as they treat themselves .
We clean the dirty ditch , sweep rubbish then we bury rubbish .
Whilst , we recyling inorganic rubbish too .
From inorganic , we can make bag , hat and other stuffs .
Then they can sell them and get income of it .
The creator of the haven and the earth , the creator of soles , the one who make earth rotate around it self and around the sun .
What we belief as Muslims that , we have created by one who do n't have other with him the one who create our father ( Adam ) and created from him ( Eve ) and they were in the Paradise and instructed to not eat from the tree but the Satan deceive them so they brought to this life and generations came from them and had sent the prophet and messengers ( Moses , Jesus , Mohamed , others .. who they worship the same one ) with Miracles and evidence of the truth , to guide the people to know who who will follow the truth which will guide to the Paradise and who follow other paths which it will guide to the hell . so because of that we are here to do the test in this short life .
Transportation is the heart of any city whether it is public or private .
Nowadays people prefer own vehicles rather than
public transportation . day by day folk are more crazy about own vehicles which leads dark future of public transportation
firstly . i agree with given statement that there would be tough time for public transportation in near future.because people wamnts privacy as well as freedom which is quite impossible in public transportation .
secondly these mode of transportation covers
as much as possible of city area or town which mismanaged routine who travelled by public transportation.as a consquence generally people avoid travelling by public transportation finally i can say that there are various mode of transporotation avaliable
to competition with public transportation .
nowadays people have numerous option fro travelling like many private company
which play an important role to give tough competition to government . as a result of this consumer gets more benefit like lower faire , privacy , freedom and safe travelling.in addition many automobile company launcing new car with affordable price which insiost people to use more and more private vechile .
I go for a walk to a park every day with my lovely two Corgi dogs .
I met many people in the park .
I never thought about , people got so many pet .
In the peak time in the park is very busy even thought the park is huge !
Some people are very friendly the same as their dog .
But some people are very rude and their dogs are aggressive to other dogs .
Family is the most important institution of social life .
Every member have his own role and the boss , the father or the mother , have to guide his team to understand the right behaviour or attitude to have with life .
Usually there are generation problems , sons do n't understand parents and vicecersa , but dialoging and listening emotions and facts , everyone can have another point of view .
Parents must give rules to sons to underline limits in social behaviour but also must listen others point of views to ri - arrange and update his knowledge .
A mother or a father can be a friend if there is communication and trust , if someone give his contribute in family duties .
Recently I saw the thriller of mokingjay part 2 .
If you want to see that movie , you need to watch the first 3 movies before to understand it .
The first movies , were amazing ! !
A lot of action , drama and romance .
The fans of this series , had been wanting for this movie science the the first movie appeared , that was in 2012 .
I do n't think that this movie is for all the family , because is hard for little kids to understand , in opinion I think is more a teen movie .
I think people will like this movie because , its very similar to the story of the book ; this one of the first movie that is really based in the book , the theme is very unique and original , also the actors in the first movies were perfect , and I think that in the last movie , they will put double effort .
Hope you guys choose this movie ! !
It will be very cool to see the las part mokingjay !
my favourite sport is Karate .
First of all , I enjoy it because when I practise I feel I can hold on for hours .
When I 've had a very bad and stressful day I can relax doing karate , because It 's the kind of sport that it is n't very hard .
Training Karate is a way to forget your problems , to forget your tiring routine .
In my opinion , it 's very difficult to fnd this advantage with others sports .
Apart from that , Karate it 's not just a sport , is also a discipline , it teach you respect , balance even culture .
my teacher show us how we have to behave with others and he teach us a lot of things about the japanese culture .
for someone who starts Karate is easy to follow the class , so my advice is just not to get nervous and to be concentrated on what he or she is doing .
Technology , is something that is very important , something without which we can not live .
Today topic is Technology .
Nowadays we use technology in every thing , from educations to making clothes , we use technology everyday and everywhere .
Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful , useful and important for development but todays generation is influenced whit technology that they have stopped to do other activities .
Last year , My friend Michael was at school when he heard about a short story competition , he liked the idea so he decided to enter the competition .
but there was a fees in order to join the competition , he had no money . fortunately he have a lot of friends they can lent him .
he phoned me and asked me to lent him some money to register the competition .
he took the money the second day , he finished the registration and started in writing the story after long time spending in writing and did good job he went to give his story to the international student magazine office , he found out there are a notice on the door say that the competition has canceled , he came back vey sad and told me what happened .Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had a mistake .
Travelling by car is n't so much more convenient unless it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the contamination in our planet .
Travelling by bus is very stressful because the people push me or I ca n't sit down because there are n't any chair for me .
On the other hand , in the future maybe would have a bus which having chair for everybody and I do n't have to stand up .
Other transport public is the taxi like car , it is so more comfortable too but it is more expensive than bus or train .
The AVE or aeroplane are a good option for long trip .
In conclusion , in the future should have a bus so more comfortable .

Dear sir Dimara .
I am writing about a problem at my city .
I live at Patras a big city in Greece .
in my city all schools and some walls of buildings are full of drawings and writing .
The vandalisme in patras has increased a lot .
Unfortunately when we say to somebody to do not draw the walls but they do not hear us .
For our city it is very bad because when some new people visit Patras they see that thing .
Patras is a very beautiful city and for her culture , and for her monuments .
After we have this beautiful city we have to maintain her .
In my opinion the police should stop the Vandalisme .
If it have police all around the city nobody will dare to do a graffiti or to write something or to draw .
I hope you will do something for that problem .
Yours faithfully ,
Jessyka stavros .
All around the world pupils are waiting for finishing school .
They are eager to begin a new life as adults .
But when they reach in - between period , confused feelings cross their minds .
As a rule after last exams they do n't know what university to choose .
What they will do in future they see , like in a fogg .
In this way , idea of a year off between leaving school and starting next education is very reasonable .
Firstly it 'll allow young people to have a rest after the first hard - work studying period .
Ten or eleven years at school make them tired , in spite of pupils do n't notice it .
But choosing the second education is very important step , which need serious attitude .
Secondly such year off would give to future students a chance to try themselves in new professional sphears .
Also they would have an opprtunity being involved in volontier activity .
And thirdly they might work for earning own money or travel .
This year holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and gettin new power for future education .
One year is not long period .
But benefits after year off will be obvious .
I live in San Miguel Almoloyan , this is a village in the municipality of Almoloya de Juarez in the State of Mexico , the care of the environment is very important and in my village they take different actions in the care of this .
People collects trash of their house and await the trash truck that carried the trash to a landfill located outside the village .
Also , people go out to collect the trash that there is on the kiosk , the church or in the principal places on the village .
Dear Sir ,
I am interested to improve my English , so I am writing to request further information about the English course .
Firstly , I would like to know how long the course lasts , and if it is possible the date exactly , because I need to book my flights .
Secondly , I do n't live in Cork , so it would be grateful if you could send me details of accommodation that you offer in this course .
And also , can you give me an idea of how much it would be cost every different options ? .
It would be useful if I can live with other students , because it is a good way to learning a language as well .
Lastly , Let me know if I need to pass any level test before starting .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully .
Rosa .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately , after listening conversations of his new neighbours .
They are planning to rob a very precious thing from Museum tonight .
He does n't have much time to prove their plan and he could not wait to let it happen .
It is his town and it is his duty too to save town 's history .
He called the police and informed about his neighbours robbery plan .
Police reached Museum and caught robbers red handed .

Hello Estela !
How are you ? I hope you are well .
I 'm writing because I tell you about my last summer holiday .
I went to Las Hurdes .
I stayed about one week in the home my boyfriend .
I had a wedding .
While I was there , I did a lot of things .
One day , I visited Meandro del melero .
It was beautiful .
And there was a wonderful view .
The other day , I walked a lot and the end the way , we found a waterfall .
The name of waterfall was Chorrituelo .
It was spectacular .
The wedding day , I had a great time and I slept very late .
The wedding was in the morning , and at the afternoon we ate in the restaurant with other people .
However , in the night , we had dinner in a garaje and there was a party , all night .
You should visit Las Hurdes , It is a beautiful site .
And there are a lot of things .
And the people are very nice .
English is an international language which becomes important for the modern world .
In China , English is took to be a foreign language which many students choose to learn .
They begin to study English at an early age .
They use at least one hour to learn English knowledge a day .
Even kids in kindergarten have begun learning simple words .
That 's a good phenomenon , for English is essential nowadays .
In addition to , some people think English is superior than Chinese .
In me opinion , though English is for great significance , but English is after all a foreign language .
it is hard for people to see eye to eye .
English do help us read English original works , but Chinese helps us learn a true China .
Only by characters Chinese literature can send off its brilliance .
Learning a country 's culture , especial its classic culture , the first thing is learn its language .
Because of we are Chinese , why do we give up our mother tongue and learn our owne culture through a foreign language ?
I was , last month , in a fantastic restaurant , Woolypools .
It is small but comfortable and famous for his big burguers .
Woolypools is a speciallist of meal , it 's a meal restaurant .
In my opinion the restaurant can be better , respect to meat , but it is perfect to have dinner with your friends .
I have expects to be more famous , better and biggest .
The problem of the restaurant is the place , it is far from the people and cities , and the space , that is very small for lots of people .
In this life we have many things that make us happy and make our lives go on .
for example , a present or a gift especially if it from your best friend .
Once , I got sick and stayed at general hospital , and my friend gave me a flower .
It was my favorite flower I have it ever .
In my town we create a small organization for more healthy environment , beauty touch and to be attractive . the citizens in the town must participate in this , the citizen will take the responsibility for specific day to clean the town and put the rubbish into correct place and clean tree and plant more of it .
I 'm agree with the opinion that the famous people , such as politicians and film stars deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
is horrible have a person behind you all the time , you not have a life , not peace , not a happy .
In adition all pearsons have the right to privacy and to be free .
Nevertheless the journalists stay all the time having a photo , all the time , when they eaten , drinking , happy , sad , how is your love life and with whoever stay , if stay with something important our what buy .
This is terrible , you do not have privacy authought the society have a blame , because if they do not take a photo our follows the life of the famous the people bored .
So that , politicians and film stars will have support it , because then they will have to bear it , because they then have the reward with what they earn .
This is all .
good morning .
How are you .
come here .
Get down .
Get in to the room .
Get in to the bus .
Let us walk .
Let us play cards .
Let us sleep .
Let me in .
Let me go .
Let me see your photos .
Let me watch your house .
Let me allow to enter in to your cabin .
Forgive me . :
Bring that toy .
bring glass of water .
Drink water .
Eat food .
Run fast .
stop shouting . do n't shout .
Let us bath .
Once upon a time was one little ant called Penny , he was really small in compared with the others .
He hated to be like that because most of the ants made fun of him until one day something horrible and inevitable happen .
It was a dark night it was raining until a big active volcano explosion buried them into the underground .
All of them tried to find a way out ! , but no one ca n't find one ... They started to get panicked !
People just started to evacuated rapidly until it began a big earthquake ...
Penny was too sad , the only thing that he can do is to wait and keep calm .
Until the dawn all of them go out , so they sacred until they find a refuge .
Everyone wanted to witness the queen , but no one find something .
Like they were very religious ants they prey for her sacred ancestors so they can help them in the big deal .
Something that they don know was that the whole thing was a movie !
So all was planned ...
The actors had monitors that watch the ants all the time .
One day Penny discovered it and it go to tell it to his queen , the queen at knowing that she get very confused but at the same time she get mad and she wanted revenge .
So they make a plan to display all ...
The next day when they were about to start filming they ere non ants there so they search for them , but they ca n't find them ...
In that moment the ants and Penny attack them in their backs , making them to leave the place .
The ants win the war and they expand their habitat to the studio .
No one attack them again and they live happily ever after !
I have many favorite sports .
One of them I 'm keen on playing basketball the best . I always spend more time on playing it .
I usually play basketball everyday around at least thirty minutes per day .
After a hard day at University I go home and then I go to the stadium to play it .
One thing makes sure that I already finished all of my work before I play my favorite sport .
Basketball has many benefits not to me but also everyone .
It makes me feel relaxed and unwind .
Besides , it also helps me keep fit and have a good body shape .
I really cra
zy about playing it .
When I have spare time , I often gather my friends to watch basketball match on television .
I often play basketball at the stadium in the morning .
Sometimes , I play it near sports centre .
I go back home and have a sleep deeply when I finished it .
basketball is an outdoor activity .
That 's reason why basketball is my favorite sport .
With the sweeping progress of development and the booming of population , many agricultueal land , forest and ocesn had been used to destroyed to build more constructure and transport networks .
From my own perspective , I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even human and animals .
To start with , there are a wide range of troublesome it maybe leadding to this phenomeon .
Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the persent day cities are already packed with places of residence , commerce and recreation and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce .
Additionally , people now continues destroyed more agricultures and forest in order to satisfy all their need , which will distory the ecosystem diversity and biodiversity especially the endangered species .
According to the problems above mentioned , various approaches that governmentshould be adopted to deal with this problem.first of all , reducing building constructure from now on , planting more trees instead .
Sustainadle development should be awaness to all human and start to porteat the environment and preserve the animals .
To sum up , this unpleasant phenmenon and problems should be worked out to resolve before thing get worse ang the governments have to take the responsibility for that .
Nowadays the languages are very important , and more English .
This is not my first time that I study English .
I have been studying English since I was child and I never speak and learn so well since I decided to go to London one course to learn this language .
I have taken that decision because I was tired to try to learn English and I did not have the level that I want , so when I heard about that ooportunity I said yes .
The car is n't the best way for for the transport , because it produce much pollution , however the public transport is better to do a journey .
It can carry many people without problems .
Nowadays in the cities developed there are many possibilities for public transport , like bus , train , subway , tram etc.these options it 's more economical than the car , the problem of the car is that normally the car is occupied for a person , when the car is prepared for to carry four or five people .
this situation to create many pollution for environment so we have more conscience for the planet health
I want to say something about the learning of the English Languaje , is hard to get to me for the next reasons :
First reason ; the grammar that the learners , teachers or institutes teach , is like the Spanish Languaje , my native Languaje .
That I want to say , is very difficult to understand the conjuntion of the verb 's in Spanish Languaje , just Imaging you the same but not in your native lenguaje .
Second reason . in the English syntaxis , the structure for construction paragraph or sentences , the verb is written before the subject , but no always , Which is the rule ?
Is there anyone ?
The third reason :
I love to play cricket .
I am enthusiastic towards this game .
My favourite team is India because I belongs to this country .
In India , 85 percent people follow cricket .
In 1993 , Indian cricket team won his first world cup and that 's change the direction of air in favour of cricket and everyone start to follow this game .
I love this game because my favourite sport man belong to this game .
His name is Mr. Sachin Ramesh Tendulakar know as little master .
Whenever I play this game , I always follow this person .
His stance , Style , shots , running between the wicket , everything which is most required in this game is up to the mark .
Not only me but also every Indian always follow Sachin for cricket .
When he was 18 , he played first game for India .
He is the first player who played 200 test in cricket .
He has many achievement like first 200 in one day etc .
I love the way he was played .
For a nuance first they have to decide what they con do better , batting or bowling .
If the person want to become bowler then concentrate on running , action , stance and for batsmen need concentration on lag and bat coordination , eye and bat coordination , discover some shots which became key factor in batting .
Also watch videos of some best player like Sachin , Rahul , Sir Don breadman , Hayden , Wasim Akaram , Brett Lee etc .
As health is important factor in every sport so also need to improve health , stamina .

It may take very long time to find a job and you have not much time here .

So these are the advice that I give to them .

The city where I live is a small village .
All residents take great care of the environment .
Organized shares , where everyone clean up the village .
All residents segregate garbage thrown into suitable containers .
Thus helping to protect our environment to make it clean , safe , in order to not jeopardize our various diseases .
In my village there are trash cans , so that no one threw debris on the ground .
There are spcejalne place where you can organize bonfires , but everyone has to clean up after themselves and throw out all garbage .
We have the ability to use renewable energy sources , because it is close to a wind power plant .
Recently , also on the roof of the primary school were set the batteries and the whole school uses solar energy instead of electricity .
They organize monthly meetings on the environment , residents participate in them .
Wszysycy residents of my village , they try to , so that our village was clear that pollute the environment as little as possible .
Travelling in their own car is way more comfortable than taking a ride in public transportation.there are several reason to consider .
Firstly , the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel .
Secondly , the public vehicle route are more far than usual route .
Thirdly , it is also crowded and no privacy .
Finally , there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker .
However , public transportation is much cheaper than to buy a new car and for the adventurer who want to have an exciting travel for then to see more action .
Like watching outside or sight seeing , to mingle and meet different people .
In addition to this I also admire the bullet train in japan which u consider fast and safe public vehicle Ive'd known .
To sum it up I still consider having their own car is way more safe and convinient .
Public future unless they have project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passenger .
As far as I 'm concerned , I tend to disagree with the decision of mineral extraction .
More details and reasons will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to support my opinion .
To begin with , extract the mineral will be harmful to our environment .
There are breathtaking sights on the outskirts of my hometown .
In my childhood , I went there to spend my summer every year .
However , it will probably be disappeared if the developing equipment were being set .
Next to go will be , the extraction of the valuable mineral will definitely leads to air pollution .
No one can deny that the pollution issue is one of the utmost important thing which should be prevented .
Last but not the least , the mineral extraction will turn out to be profound influence , especially , to our offspring .
To take my friend , Taylor , as an example , her homeland were over - developed and become an arid place when she was a child .
After she grows up , she decides to leave and never go back to her hometown .
In addition , she has no blithe memory in her childhood .
One problem is that some people will consider the job opportunity that it might bring to us .
Due to the mineral development , many people in our hometown can probably earn much more money than before .
It seems like a sought - after chance .
Nevertheless , they do not give us any promise of the vacancy .
In addition , money is no more crucial when it comes to health and environmental conservation .
In a nutshell , Based on the reasons and instances above , the disadvantages of extract the valuable mineral are outweigh the advantage .
Therefore , I do not subscribe to this decision .
Limiting cars on the roads would cause the disappearing of poo .
The fossil fuels used by vehicles cause global warming .
Global warming is a serious issue , higher temperatures make the ice caps melt .
The longer we burry our heads in sand , the warmer the Earth will be .
I learn English to improve the general quality of my sentences !
I do n't believe in it , especially while cars are not flying .
Even if it will have happened there are many people who ca n't get a car , because it is too exspensive , not only for buying but for fuel , service and so forth .
Buses are more simple - you just buy a ticket .
And what about trains ?
I saw tv about train in Japan - that is the future of public transport .
I want to see blue sky and not stream of cars like it was in the film " The Fifth Element "

I have 3 siblings in my family who are taking care by me all the time when parents are busy with their works .
During my school , I like to play volleyball and i 'm an excellent player .
We used to organise competitions and tournaments with others school .
This is my favourite sport .

Contemporary Art is a very controversial issue nowadays .
There are many sources and creators , as well as themes .
It is well known that many Art curators and Artists believes that Contemporary Art is not a good source of art , since there are many artists that only create based in their easy ideas of an aesthetic image or a philosophical idea , but most of the times this is unintelligible .
Luckily the most expensive art still being the old , like Picasso or Freud .
Nowadays a lot of empty art pieces are being sold at auctions around the world , for extraordinary high prices .
Experimental Art has taken the world of art by surprise .
Humanity has reached a level of differences that it would be not possible to stop .
The sports days were held on Kwai Chung Sports Ground in 12th and 13 th November .
That weather was partly cloudy .
I got there by MTR .
I arrived the sports ground at 7:40 a.m. This year I 've join the 100-metre race .
On the first day before the sports day begin , we have the opening ceremony .
After that , the sports day began formally .
At 10:45 a.m. , the girl 's grade C 100-metre race started .
There was a funny thing when I went to the marshal .
The teacher call my name for twice and he told me to stand different place .
So I know that there was someone whose name pronounce same as me .
Near the race , I was very nervous .
When I was running , I heard my housemates cheering and the wind passing my face .
That feel was very comfortable and made me felt relax .
At last , I got number 10 out of 27 people .
Although it is not a great result , I 've already try my best .
At last of the day , our school announced the mark the four houses have got .
My house which got number two temporarily .
I felt hopeful and wanted my house will get the champion .
On the second day , my classmates called me to take part the Inter - class relay race .
I felt very afraid because I was not good at running .
Finally , our class got the first runner up .
We have a difference of 0.5 seconds is the first of the race .
I implicated my class from winning the champion .
At last , my house got the second runner up .
I hope my house will get the champion in the next year .
" There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient " .
In my opinion , this affirmation is not correct .
We should used of public transport because at the present there are a lot of cars in the world that pollute and unfortunately we are harming the environment and the world .
It is the best that all people go to the place walking o running on the other hand it is more healthy .
There is nothing wrong with it go to the place in a car , obviously , it is faster than a bus and cheaper but no always .
I think it is true that travelling by car is so much more convenient but I disagree that there is no future for public transport .
Is is commonly - debated that tourism has greatly influenced , not only the aspects of one country , but of the whole world along .
Whethere tourism has had a positive or a negative impact over our lifes , it remains quite a dilemma for the ignorants .
First of all , tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world .
Alongside with its development , the ablity of travalling has easened to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another .
The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisation , since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen .
Secondly , tourism , especially in developed countries , has played an important part in their growing from an economic point of view .
There are countries , such as Greece or Bulgaria , in which the econmoy relies merely on tourism .
If tourism influences the econmy , it thereby influnces the environment , and if it influences the environment it influences the transport . How?people become more careful at their historcal sites , this way preserving them;Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale :
At a small scale , in cities , in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficently .
At a large scale , people can now travel in almost any possible way : on land , on sea or air .
Through the development of tourism were born cruises and train vacations .
One upon a time there was a tiger who lives in a beautiful landscape with her boyfriend and her 3 daughters .
The tiger was the mom names Amanda of 25 years old , the herders kill her parents , because the herders were poor and do n't have enough food to survive , so they kill them .
The tiger 's boyfriend was a lion names John of 27 years old , his dad die because in a conflict with other animals , he got an infection .
Her mom die because some things or someone drag her of the leg and drop it in a cave were other animals eat her .
They die when John was too little to remember and he never know what happened so he went to all the parts for saw them even he walked and walked even at reverse but he never found them .
The 3 daughters where so different each other .
The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah .She have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots .
The second daughter names Elizabeth is a leopard is the intelligent of the family and the oldest of the daughters .
Had 12 years old .
Another animals give them rewards or bonus because she discover that water was liquid .
The last daughter was Ana who was the youngest of the family is a jaguar .
She stay sleeping in the bed and doing nothing all day .
Their parents were angry because she was the only one that never work .
One they animals went with Ana and give her an incentive for being an athlete or make something else than stay sleeping .
The end .
Hello friend ,
I know you are searching for a flat to live for the whole next year .
Maybe I found something for you : when I were on the bus returning to home I read a journal with some advertisements .
There is a nice flat near my home : it is perfect to someone who want to live there for only an year .
There are a little kitchen , a great bedroom , a bathroom with shower but without bath and a cool living - room .
I think that you have to bring with you winter clothes because here there is a really cold weather !
Write me soon

Hello Riley , about the question you made me in your letter , it has been hard to give you an answer because I know how much you love both .
Last night I made a decision .
I think that you should give up from your music classes .
You have classes since you were nine years old and you already know how to play piano , so I think that you should continue doing sports because it is important for your health and in your free times you could still play piano without going to the classes .
This is my opinion but the decision is yours , so when you decide it please send me a letter telling me about it .
Love , Ines .
Hey my name is Joe and i 'm 21 years old and i'l think i'l would compliment the summer camp very good , because of my good manner and very open for the kids so they can open up and speak .
My current job is to be a nurse at the local hospital and i'l can do everything as a doctor can .
So if the kids is going to hurt themselves , then i'l can fix them up instead of taking them to the hospital for small things like bruises and smaller injuries .
The most exciting day of my life was the 3rd of June , last year .
I had an exam .
That day I woke up early because I was nervous .
Then I revise Maths as at home , before to go at school , as at school , before to begin the exam .
When I started to read the tracks I fell agitated and I thought that I was n't able to finish and pass that test .
But when I finished before the time I was happy and relaxed .
I always said that I passed that test and I was sure of that .
And this is true .
I passed that test !
Hello Charlie ,
I 'm really enjoyed hearing from you .
Congratulations your sister for your prize .
I would like to go to a new artist rolls competition , although in my city there are n't a lot of competitions of this kind If I 'd have a posibility of going , I 'd already spend the tickets .
My favourite sport
When I was three years old , my parents went skiing with me .
At the beginn I went to the childgarden and they taught me skiing .
It was a lot of fun , because I could not it .
At twelve o'clock in the daytime my parents took me with them and we drove together .
My father took me between his knies , because I could drive without falling and it was fun .
When I was older , I could get better my dream was:"SNOWBOARDING " , but I should learn skiiing perfectly like my parents .
Later when I was 16 years old , my dream get true .
I had my first snowboardlesson und I loved it .
I took every free minute to drive snowboard .
That was the story why I go snowboarding .
I enjoy snowoarding , because you feel free when you are driving down the piste .
You are like a bird .
It is the best feeling in the world .
You are very happy und sometimes I sing a song and the world is perfect .
That is everything I want to have and i 'm lucky .
That 's why I like the winter more than the summer .
Snowboarding or skiing is the best sport for everyone who want to come to other thoughts .
Although you are all the time in the nature and when you have luck you can see animals .
It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
Yesterday , he was on his way to home and it was getting dark .
his parents were worried and called he a couple of times .
Everything was dark .
She open her eyes and the first thing that she saw was the black sky .
A dark sky without stars .
She got up and look around .
She was in a part of the woods where she used to go to think and relax .
She started to take consciousness although she could n't remember how she arrived there .
She had to walk at least 15 minutes to go from her house to this place .
The problem is the last thing she remember is that she has been sleeping and then suddenly woke up when the window opened with the wind .
She fell sleep again , didn't she ?
If she did , how she managed to walk until there in her sleep ?
If she was n't awake , why she could n't remember anything after that ?
This situation it was really fustrating not to mention that now she had to walk for almost 20 minutes to get home and back to sleep .
She started to walk to clear her mind .
She knows her way even in the dark ; she had gone to this spot a lot of time , specially the last few weeks .
The development of human kind in technology is seen everywhere .
In case of transportation technology , in this twenty first century we have various option like Plan that can fly with the cloud , train that fast and big enough that carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of mile an hour and boat that much bigger and faster than ancient time .
Although compared to ancient time we are lucky enough that we have all these option .
However , if I have given option to choose between all of three , I will say plane .
There are three reason to choose this .
First reason is its speed , compare to both other means of transportation it can travel faster .
It can travel thousand of miles in a couple of hours .
As a result people can save their time .
Second is safety , compared to other the chances of accident is less .
That makes it safer to travel by plane rather than the train or boat .
Third one is comfort level .
Plan is much more more comfortable than both train and boat .
In conclusion , I will say that plan will be my first choice in all of three means of transportation .
The reason behind my choice is speed , safety and comfort level that make plan as my first choice .
Everyone should take a year off between leaving school and starting college or university , to earn money or travel , it would be the best award for a student who attended the high school .
The young people want to discover the world and travelling to reach places which would be unreachable otherwise
I had a wonderful day yesterday because I was in the beach all the afternoon .
I went with my parents and my sister .
The beach is located in A Guarda and its name is O Muiño .
There are a lot of people in the beach .
The water was very cold and I could n't swim , then I played football in the sand of the beach .
I took the sun a very long time and then I go to a cafe and and I drank a refreshment .
It was a nice day because I spent a good time with my family .
No future for a public transpotr ? is this claim or no ?
will we see on our roads the public transport afer 5 or eve 10 years yet ? that is really so interesting question/
i think that it all depands from the development .
now we can see that more and more people prefer travelling by car .
yes , i agree , if you planed the travelling for a long distation and for a long time you would prefer to do it on car , couse firstly you;ll spend less time , you travelling will be comfortable , you 'll have a possibility to stop every where and for a long time , as you need .
but if we are talking abot travelling across you city , would you prefer public transport or car ?
i think that this is the guestion for every one , and the answer ca n't be one for all , cause , someone can use public transport , and economy by this not only money , but and the environment , but some people do n't like to use p.t . , cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple do n't like to travell with another people .
so , on my opinion , even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passangers

Volleyball in one of the most difficult sports in the world , you should put your body in the correct form to throw the ball to the other side in the game .
I been twelve years practice volleyball and because of it I knew lot of people who help me to grow up in the sport and life .
When I was 10 I be choose to play with a group of girls older than me , they were goods , and I ca n't believe the experience .
Volleyball its my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing I were in another world , in which I can be free and happy , apart of this , when I am bad , this is a distration of the university .
You should try practice its so funny , but I advertise you , is not easy at first , but you hace to intent many times like you should do in life .
In weekdays , I get off from my bed at 7 in the morning to go to my work which startst at 9 AM .

However I sometimes do a skipping to fit myself .
Michael wake up at the morning and he read the newspaper .
He read in the newspaper an interesting noticie .
The noticie was about a competition .
The competition is about write stories .
Michael was excited because he is great writer and he decided to compete .
First , he found an idea for the story and he decided to make the story about pirates looking for treasure .
He began to write .
The story was very good but Michae did not know how to end the story .
Finally , Michael ended the story and he went to the post office .
Michael sent the story but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake , he did n't put his name and address .
Yes , i think TV can entertain and educate , because there are many comedy .
Also there are a lots of educate channels .
I think historical channels are very interesting , because you can learn new thing about past .
Comedies are so funny , so when you are sad u can watch one of them .
There are many discussions about the future of the public transport .
Different experts had talked about this question and there are so several opinions .
People like to have the freedom for moving comfortably and for this reason , some people usually prefer to use their cars .
Public transport usually is restrected with the timetables and you only may use the transport in the moment that the timetable let you .
For this way , many people do n't like to use the public transport because they want to move themselves when they need .
By the other hand , public transport is better for the environment , because the pollution is lesser than using your own car .
Finally , in the future , the commodity of people maybe is going to determinate the most use of the cars than the public transport .

Dear Paul !
I haven't written you for ages but I was very busy because of the exams at the University .
What about you?What 's new in Brazil?As you know , my friend John asked me to help him with the organization at the concert , which was performed last month .
So I was there something like staff .
My work consisted of making press advertising , providing all ticket , food for musicians and things like that .
I got two free V.I.P tickets , so I took my girlfriend and we were there together .
When the concert finished , we went to cloakroom to get signatures from musicians .
I felt like a star!Crowded of people were waiting in front of the cloakroom for the signatures , but only me and my sweety girlfriend got them .
People were so envious ... I liked it!It was fantastic experience .
Next time I would like to do something similar and you should try it as well . You will earn nice money and you have cultural experience .
Hope to see you soon
John
The advertising is everysite .
There are adds in TV , radio , bus , streets ...
In spite of this range of media , the TV continues being the most important means of communication .
A lot of people think that there are too many adds on television but , is like that ?
On one hand , it 's true that one programme or series which we see , has a lot of mentions to products or services .
There can be people tired of so much advertising contents but this is completely necessary .
There are a lot of products which have to be announced and a lot of messages to report to people .
The TV is the most accesible way of communication and people can see the messagen on this way .
In addition , behind one add there are a lot of things : one industry .
In one add there are , for example , the publicist 's work , the companies investments , future sales , the product or service 's life ...
To sum up , there are a lot of adds in TV but they are necessary and beneficial for everyone .
My favourite season of the year is summer .
Why am I making this choice you clearly can ask , I love sun and good weather .
Yes it is true that during summer the temperature is very hot and you can rarely stay near the sun because you finish t be burn by the sun .
In spite of this , summer is a very good moment to enjoy little things life gives us and have fun with them .
During summer I love to go to the beach and having sunbathing with my friends other than getting fun with them playing volleyball or run inside the water of the sea !
I think those activities are very regenerating and they make you forget about all the warmness of summer .
Furthermore you can sleep more than the other days of the year and this make you feel relaxed .
I really like to explore nature during summer too .
The wonderful colours of flowers with the sunshine are fabulous .
Dear USA SUMMER CAMPS ,
I saw your advertisement in the USA and I 'm very interested in the position of childminder you are advertising .
I 'm eighteen years old and I 'm doing a languages translation degree at university at the moment , that 's why I need to work in order to pay my fee .
I have some experience working with children from all ages , besides I do n't mind hard work and I learn quickly .
Also I 've just got my FCE certificate this year but it would help me a lot if I practised my English in a native country .
I consider myself really active , sociable , well - organized and above all patient , therefore I think I 'm suitable for this job as I can adapt myself easily at any kind of situation or environment , especially working overseas plus it would be a nice experience because I would meet new people and a different culture .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours faithfully ,
Teresa Wysocki
It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
He finally , after 5 years , won swimming competition .
It was really importatnt for him because he was training for 5 long years since he was 15 and he haven't got any achievements .
He was very happy and he decided to celebrate .
He invited all his friends from team and made a party .
Tom wanted Mel , his girlfriend , to come too .
She was really proud of him .
She was dreaming about being his wife .
She wanted to be his wife so bad .
But he did n't love her enough .
He wanted to break up with her at that party .
He was waiting 2 hours for her .
He hated that she is always late .
That was the main reason he wanted to end it up .
When Mel came she looked gorgeous .
And when he saw her , his heart started to beating faster and faster .
But time 's up .
He got closer to her and told her everything .
Mel looked sadly at Tom , then said : " I 'm pregnant ... " and got out of his home .
He followed and apoligized her .
He said he was drunk and did n't know what he was saying .
Then he hugged her .
He said he loved her and kissed her forehead .
He had to stay with her because of ... the baby .
He could n't just leave her carrying his baby !
No ! He has never acted like this .
He knew that he had to stay with her the rest of his life and raise the baby .
He decided to give swimming up and started to taking care of Mel .
One day Mel was feeling really bad so Tom took her to the hospital .
He felt that something bad was going to happen .
And he was right .
Mel has lost the baby .
Tom had to make a hard decision .
His life was going to change .
Mel was crying all day and Tom could n't stand it .
He has broken up with Mel and it made her much more sad .
He did n't care .
He thought it was her fault that she has lost their little human .
Gliding in the waves
Even if I am not a very interested in training , the sport I really prefer to practice is swimming .
The sensation of being embraced by the water , feeling the body quite without weigh , able to do a lot of movement that are impossible while in the air , is a wonderful state of mind .
I started to practice swimming in pool because I was n't able to swim at all , and I wanted to learn .
I have been taking lessons for six months , so I improved so much my abilities .
If you are not a good swimmer , you lose the big part of pleasure of enjoying the water , both in the sea or in pool .
Practice swimming is quite hard work , especially if you need to learn the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity .
I recommend that you do n't have to give up before trying , because is fairly simple and it can gives a lot of satisfactions !
Your efforts will be prized by succeeding , and you can obtain it with practice .
·Introduction
This report will examine the different activities we can do in our leisure time in Castelldefels .
·Activities to kill time
As our town is well - known for our magnificul beaches along the Mediterranean coast and for the Olympic Canal of Castelldefels , many foreign or local people come here to do activities like kitesurfing and windsurfing on the beah or canoening and aquatic skiing on the Olympic Canal .
These activities are the most popular and the most expensive too .
However , I fully recommend them , especially for sporty , adventurous and young people .
·Others ideas to have fun
In Castelldefels , there are other activities less popular , but cheaper , for instance : free zumba masterclass , yoga beach , running ... as sports activities , and as social activities there are library group , theatre ...
As I said , these activities are not as popular as the activities of the Olympic Canal and the beach , but their success is increasing more and more .
·Recommendation
So , finally I suggest that it would be a great idea to combine the different types of activities , both popular and the newest .
If you tried all the activities , you would spend a great time here , in Castelldefels !
Hi Jane ,
How are you ? .
I was glad to hear from you .
I 'm writing to tell you the best way to arrive at Salou .
You will come to the Reus airport , right ? .
Well , the airport is located just outside Reus , it 's small but it has a lot of servicies and transport .
You have to take a bus because it is more economical than take a taxi .
The bus stops at the Salou bus station .
When you get off the bus you should ask someone for the Spring Street .
It 's near there .
You can walk to my house .
Moreover I send you a map in order to locate the street .
This is my address : 4 Spruce avenue .
I 'm planning your visit .
I 'd like to visit museums , monuments and going to clubbing with you .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Best Regards ,
Mary

Nowadays there are many people that are learning foreign language , for me is a good thing that more people learn this , but is it worth learning a foreign language ?
Firstly , there are more multinational companies that need people to speak other languages , so that means that the people who know to speak foreign language have more opportunities to get a job in important companies , or will have more chances of being promoted .
On the other hand , are more benefits , for example , if you want to travel to another a country is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand all without complications .
Finally , learning another language gives the learner the ability to step inside the mind and context of that other culture .
Today globalization is bringing the world more close , that means that there are more possibilities to have contact with the other cultures , for example in literature , poetry , films , TV programs , music or some other aspect of the culture .
On balance , learning foreign languages is very positive on different aspect , so if you have the positivity of learning a new language do it , because it will bring you many benefits .

Given is a diagram introducing the procedures of making bank notes .
Desgin the bank notes are the first and indispensable step .
Peple should decide the background colour and thw artwork while they have to consider the security issues .
Then , skilled machinists would prepare the metal plates in order to go to the next step .
The third section is to print the prepared bank notes .
Usually there will be 50 ban notes per sheet .
The colour will print on the both sides and every notes has their unique ink also the images will be slightly raised .
After that , it comes to the most significant stage , that is inspect the quality of the printed sheets .
People usually divided the quality into three parts : Good quality , Partially damaged , and bad sheets .
As for good quality sheets and partially damaged sheets but still good , people will cut them separately and pack them together in order to dispacting and distributing the bank notes .
If the partially damaged sheets are bad , they will be treated as bad sheets , which will be securely distoryed .
In conclusion , the diagram gives a quite explicit process of making bank notes .
Eventhough it seems to be easy to make them , but every steps needs people to be very careful in order to produce the perfect bank notes for everyone .
A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE
Beginings
Everything began a few years before , when Alfred , The Major , read an article about the importance of the surroundings in health and happinness of people .
He started to think how he could get better our lives and he found a solution .
A concerned population
While youngsters use their time trying to get concerned the oldest people from de village about the importance of the care of our surroundings , middle - aged people planted many trees around the village and cleaned the floor of our public places making a more attractive place to live than we used to have .
Easy recycling
Local authorities helped this initiative creating some places for people to leave their rubbish in order to be taken to the recycling center with the purpose of giving a new life to our waste .
The results
As a result of this attitude , since Alfred had this great idea , we enjoy one of the cleanest villages in the area .
People now is worried about the future of our planet and an association has been created in order to promote the care of our planet , Green Planet is called .
We want a happy Earth .
Hello Luis Blanco ,
I 'm writing you about the staff recruitment for the " New Cloud Generation " project .
So we need your help with some questions about the process .
For your information , we are looking for people with three years of experience in similar projects , who are engineers and also have a high team work skill .
We also value that they have specialised studies in Cloud technology , and hosting management .
However it 's possible that we do n't find enough people with that profile so , we could accept people with one year of experience .
Is it possible to do the meeting this week ?
When and where do you prefer ? ( Remember that I work from 8 a.m to 6 p.m ) I suggest we can do the meeting at your office , so you do n't have to move to another place .
Finally I need you to prepare some profiles that you think the staff of New Cloud Generation should have , and please tell me if you find another different request than I tell you before in that e - mail .
Please , answer me with the information as soon as possible .
Íñigo Ojeda .
Dear Paul ,
What 's up ?
Do you remember when I told you I had been helped at a concert ?
It was really exciting and unforgettable experience and I enjoy that very much .
You probably wo n't believe me but I met all members of Dżem band , I talked to them and we had lunch together , they 're very nice men . Because of helping them I had the best place during the concert and I have their authographs on the newest record . I did n't have many duties and none of them were unpleasant .
In general I had only one duty that is checking quest list , above that I had to help in cleaning area after the concert .
But that concert was worth of my work , so I hope I will be invited to their next event .
Working for them was a real pleasure .
I suppose we 'll see each other soon and I 'll be capable of talking to you about this experience .
Love ,
Dominika
Report :
The aim of this report is to give you my personal point of view of the course I did in your branch in Madrid last month .
In addition , I would like to give you some suggestions I think it would be worth it to take it into account for the next course it will take place next year .
First , I would like to stand out the outstanding classmates there were in class .
They were not only really clever people but also excellent co - workers .
Working collaboratively is , in fact , the most interesting way of learning any subject even English .
Second , the teachers were really good skills to teach .
They managed to encourage all of us every day .
This way we made the most of us and never gave up improving our English level .
Third , phonetic classes scheduled on Fridays came really in handy .
They helped me to pronounce words better than before starting the course .
However , in my opinion there should have been at least one native teacher in the teacher 's team .
This way we had been able to hear a native speaker and I think it would have been worth practising .
To wrap up the report just say that on the whole the course was fantastic and I am looking forward to signing it again next year .
Yours sincerely ,
Juan Orozco
I am keen on cinema thus I love to watch all types of fims .
But , what films are in my Top 100 list ?
In my opinion , Babel is a fascinating film with a dramatic and thrilling storyline that is a top 100 best movies .
I really enjoy it because the plot is original and it shows different life stories of moving characters .
In addition , I think that the settings are very reallistic and the actors had a great performance .
Therefore , I recommend that drama genre lovers watch Babel as its message will move you .
It reveals that our feelings cross the boundaries of all cultures and we are connected to each other .
My name is Mohamed El - Shamoun .
I am 20 years old , living in Port - Said , Egypt .
I am a student in the 3rd year of the faculty of medicine Port - Said University .
My father works as a teacher and so does my mother .
I have one brother and one sister .
I have been doing Judo for the past 11 years with a lot of prizes .
My hobbies are travelling , reading stories and writing my thoughts .
I am interested in scientific research and analyzing information so I am taking a lot of courses and training in this field as I want to be one of the greatest researchers in the world in addition to becoming a member in World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
It is n't just a dream in my mind but I work hard to make this dream come true .
Last two years , I worked in many places such as a pharmacy , a restaurant and the water purification company .
I believe that work is everything and experience can make miracles in our life so I chose this program as I want to learn and study , I want to know more and more .
In my childhood , my dream was to become an engineer but when I changed my career to medicine , I realized that Allah chose the best for me and for my personality .
When I work anything I feel that I have the world in my hand so I can do anything for people .
One of my goals in the life is to invent an effective drug for one the incurable like cancer , AIDS and hepatitis .
I asked myself many times what is the aim of our life ?
And what are the benefits of work and study ?
But if you see your world and realize it well , it will be deserved from everyone to work so hard and achieve their hopes .
I learnt from Research that you can do everything in anytime in addition a little tired can change the life for the better .
I like travelling and visiting new places in my country and my dream is travelling to all the countries in the world also , I attended a lot of conferences in my field so I think this program is a chance for experience which will help and inspire me for the community services and development my society as I hope to come back and teach others what I learn .

I am a preschool teacher and I have experience looking after chilren from 3 to twelve yeras old . I consired myself quite patient and fun that in my opinion , they are two qualities highly necessary for this kind of job .
I am good too at working in a team .
I do not like to be or feel alone , this could be one of my great weakness .
I really love being with people all the time .
I do not think being young will be a problem .

Is there a future for Privately owned cars ?
To be honest , I am not sure .
Although privately oned cars are more and more popular , and they are increasingly becoming a common asset even in developing countries , it is not likely that this means of transport can be the means of transport of the future .
Most people today realize that in our cities and in our planet there ia an increasing problem of space and pollution .
Carbon based fuels will not last forever .
I would say that most probably private care are not " sustainables " in the long term , and it will be necessary to revert to some sort of public transport .
The population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years the world population will grow of a staggering 3 billions human beings .
I know that it is nice to dream a future of technological people flying around , each of them with its own private small helicopter .
But it is not going to happen .
I guess that in our future there are no helicopters , and not even cars .
States and local authorities will have to tackle the problem and provide the public with a better alternative . T
he price for independent transport will grow dramatically .
I reckon that that will change the habits of the public .
Even though we will have to read the timetable and to learn again to be on time , the nice old train could become important again .
Imagine this picture : the first class of this semester , students are yawning and do not pay attention on the teacher ; while the teacher ask for the answer , students can not answer because they totally can not remember what they have studied in last semester .
Students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying partly because of after the long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned , partly because of long vacation will let students used to have fun instead of study , and partly because of some difficult courses should be continually studying .
Therefore , I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
More reasons and detail will be shed light on in the following paragraphs .
To begin with , there is a general consensus , students will forget the knowledge they have learned after a long break time .
For example , on history class , history teacher have to repeat teaching the history of North America before he start to teach the history of South America in the beginning of the semester .
It is very wasting time and not efficient .
Next to go would be , students get used to relax by having no study and homework in the long vacation .
For example , when the semester start , students can not get away from the sunshine , beach , and travelling .
In the class , students will recall the joyful time they had instead paying attention on the teacher .
Last but not least , some difficult courses should be continually studying rather than having long a break time .
For instance , learning English should be a daily education , if you have a long time without learning English , you could forget the vocabulary or the grammar .
In a nutshell , based on aforementioned , I totally I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
My favourite sport is the soccer .
I enjoy this sport since I was a child , I always remember when my father and my brother teach me to play it .
My father was a professional soccer player so I think that I inherited this love for the soccer .
I played soccer in different teams in my neighborhood , school or university .
I always enjoy playing soccer because when I am in the playing field I forget all problems .
I like to speak with my team partners .
Together we analyze the rival team and we choose a strategy to win the match .
when I play bad I feel nervous but my parters give me their unconditional support .
that is priceless .
I know the health is very important so if you practise this sport there is a big probability that you are healthy .
So if you are starting this sport you have to do it because you really like it .
if you do n't like it there are many options to practise whatever sports .
The soccer is not a violent sport but sometimes it becomes .
In this way you have to be prepared for anything problem .
Finally I advise that you enjoy playing this awesome sport .
On my vacation I went to New York .
I also went to the amazing Niagara Falls .
Something that made me happy was to see my family .
On september 12th,2014 I went to New York city .
In the fly I was very happy because I received a lot of food .
The flight was approximatly five hours where I watch beautiful movies .
When I arrived my uncle was waiting for me and I gave him a big hug .
We went to long island because there he lives .
He have a really nice house and I was happy to see my little cousin " Angel " who looks just like me .
In New York I eat so much , I also went to the city thay never sleeps , Manhattan .
My uncle had the awesome idea of going to Niagara Falls .
We went in car and it was about 8 hours long .
Finally we arrived to Niagara Falls city that looks like a ghost place .
It does not have too much to do but there were the falls .
I was amazed of how huge were the falls .
They were incredible amazing and beautiful .
I take too much photos because you do nt visit places like that everyday .
Something that made me very happy was to visit my family .
My uncle Juan lives in United States of America and I was very to hug him because I miss him a lot .
My cousin Angel was very happy to see me and me too , we are like siblings .
My aunt gave me a lot of presents because she say they do not see me frecuently and many other part of my family .
In conclusion I have a perfect vacation where I saw new things , visit awesome places as Niagara Falls and Time Square , recieving a lot of presents and soecially eat a lot delicious food .
Most attending students to Universities are out of the city where they used to live , so , they need an accommodation to live through their study years .
Most universities provide cheap accommodations such as , shared rooms and dormitories to their students to lower the living costs , where most students have low income .
Other students who may have family financial support prefer to hire an apartments to live independently
Sharing houses or rooms have many advantages such as , cheap , safe , close to the university , and learn how to share everything with others . saving money and time will be more Obvious in university dormitories because monthly payments will be less than four times than hiring an apartment , and because it will be closer to the university , saving money and time is more efficient by reducing transportation 's costs
In spite all these benefits , I prefer- if I can - to live in an apartment where the personality is very important for me .
Many years ago , I shared a friend in a room for few months during a course outside my country , these days where I worst during my life , he was dirty , speaking loudly all time and did not share the budget of eating . living alone will grant me the freedom to live by the way that I choose and still friendly with all the others without exceed the privacy of my friends . this matter will not achieved when living in shared rooms .
they annoying me
Although The federal government which is decided as a role of USA has many benefits according to reading passage , the lecturer believes that there is no perfect government .
The powerful of the federalism which has more liberty for the states to have their own policies according to their needs , is not always good for the lecture where it may create some conflicts between the states .
An example of that is the marriage of homosexual where some state admit this marriage , others do n't .
Also , the reading passage declares that even the federal government let each state function independently , it still control on the main decisions .
this case causes some problems where the lecturer mentioned the failure of federal government to stop illegal immigration to USA through Nevada desert .
also the control of the federal government is the reason why each of the state and the federal blame each other in the increase of the unemployment in some states
In conclusion , federal government which give freedom and powerful , cause many problems such as no single policy and confusion in the responsibility .
Travelling to a different country can be both exciting and frustrating at the same time .
I think that any type of trip is exciting but also have their frustrating moments .
In order to enjoy travelling to Mexico I would give two important advice ; first try to get alone with travel companion and enjoy Mexican food instead to critic about spicy savor .
People say that in every voyage the people suffer to different moments of the trip : arrived , get away to the frustration of an unknown place , get alone with your trip companion , success as a traveler and arrived home triumphal .
In order to enjoy a trip to Mexico I suggest that the traveler find a manner to get alone with his or her companion .
This minimal chance would make a big difference when you visit other city .
As an example , if you are able to get alone with your travel companion could enjoy each moment of the trip , exchange some pictures , eat together , and visit places with common interest such as museums or malls .
Other advice that I would give to people coming to Mexico is that enjoy for Mexican food .
Mexican food has a lot of tasting dishes from different states of the country .
For example , there are a lot of American people that does n't like spicy food and also most of the times could get angry with the excess of pepper that the Mexican people used to use to prepare their food .
As advice I would suggest you to ask for sauces with lower pepper .
In this way the visitors would be able to enjoy Mexican food with less pepper and the same delicious savor that is so characteristic of our country .
In conclusion , I offered two important advice for visitors that coming to my country : Try to get alone with their companion in order to have fun and try to enjoy Mexican food because it is delicious !
After the Internet was invented and revealed first time in August 29th 1969 , Social Media Site ( SMS ) is the next most significant innovation that has partly replaced for face to face communication .
SMS such as Facebook send out 700.000 messages , and 170.000 Tweets are publicized on Twitter each 60 seconds .
Unsurprisingly , social consequences of Facebook and Twitter plays an important role in communication , regardless of distance or time .
However , people who use Facebook , Twitter or SMS in general , are not likely to have their own personal privacy that there is a possibility of cycle of bullying .
This essay will force on benefits and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter , and also comments potential future of these implications .
Communicating can be achieved , regardless of distance , through Facebook and Twitter .
The benefit of being from being connected globally to Facebook and Twitter is that messages can be transmitted almost instantly to viewers .
Firstly , Facebook and Twitter can be used when their users are in an unpleasant mood , and in where their negative feelings are expressed .
Secondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in touch with daily activities from friends , making observations of relationships , maintaining one 's own feeling within the network ( through wall posts , pokes , messages , etc ) ( Oldmeadow , Quinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .
That is to say , human behaviour on Facebook are interacted we with others by sharing their mood , and receiving responses .
Thirdly , Facebook can be used as an organizational communication tool in business .
Knowledge about the members increases continually , and moreover , maintaining relations with other existing members , and also sharing their same interests by the social network .
( Emerald Group Publishing , 2013 ) .
Finally , people are allowed to follow anyone who they find enjoyable through Twitter .
For instance , by following famous celebrities , people can easily see every daily activities which are posted by them .
However , due to this , people who are being followed , or users in general , may have less personal privacy , and also there is a high potential of being purposely aggressive toward someone .
However , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily response as a public opinion .
However , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily response as a public opinion .
Mostly Facebook users expect their friend to respond or pay attention on what they are doing .
In fact , along with agreeable and pleasant comments , there are also small amounts of aggressive and even racist comment .
First of all , people can post any racist comments which target a specific group or person .
For example , after the premier of The Hunger Game was released , a fan posted an onset racist tweet that saying that they were unhappy because one of the main actresses was performed by Black person ( Rauch and Schanz , 2013 ) .
Because of the accessible information through SMS , it has led to many problems involve with cycle - bullying , cycle - badgering , cycle - stalking behaviour ( Krishna , as cited in Williams & Merten , 2008 ) .
For example , Krishna et al.(2013 ) reports a case of continuous disturbing a woman from a man called Mr .
X " admitted to a state psychiatric hospital after being found not competent to stand trial on charges of stalking harassment , trespassing and telephone harassment " ( pp .
576.e1 - 576.e2 ) .
Potentially , Facebook and Twitter , and SMS in general , may replace face to face communication and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without have to view each other appearances .
Therefore , it would be easier to be connected and keep in touch with friends within a second , rather than have to call them .
The possibly outcomes might be the more time people spend on SMS , the less communicate skills that they have .
In addition , to decrease the risk of negative comments or posts , Facebook and Twitter would improve their futures to solve the less personal privacy problem .
For example , controlling what posts should be sent by adding more privacy options .
However , despite the useful of these implications , people should pay attention that Facebook and Twitter could affect their social life by avoid using it most of the time .
In conclusion , the benefits from using Facebook and Twitter is that people can communicate and being connected to their friends frequently .
Also people can easily reduce their negative mood by sharing and expressing how they feel .
In contrast , because Facebook and Twitter have been connected worldwide , which means protecting personal privacy is probably impossible .
Possibly , users might express aggressive toward each other , because of lack of privacy .
Photography classes for everyone
Introduction
Teenagers are constantly influenced by social networks like Facebook , Instagram , Pinterest , etc .
Photographs are included in all of those sites .
Also , this phenomenon of taking photographs is part of our daily life , because it is the best way to capture special moments like birthdays , travels , special ocassions , etc .
As a new college subject
This practice is considered those activities that anyone can do without any kind of special preparation .
However , teaching students how to apply better techniques in the moment of taking a picture should be consider as learning to draw .
Both skills are required in today 's world and are necessary to be developed in the education system at the same level .
The reasons
Recent studies show that in the last twenty years more than 3,000 photographs are taken per person in the world , especially in the latest generations lifes(teenagers and kids ) .
This increase is related with the overwhelming development of technologies in computers , cameras , cellphones , etc .
Also , photography is considered as a type of art , so it requires the knowledge of especial skills , techniques and knowledge .
What a lovely weather today !
What a wonderful day ! There is an April now and finally spring came .
A bright sun is shining , the snow melted away in March .
The first spring birds came back from the warm countries .
They are singing funny and building their nests .
People look happier .
They are feeling tired after a long snowy winter .
We set our clock forward one hour in March .
The summertime was first introduced in England in 1908 .
The days become longer and the nights get shorter and lighter .
We usually set our clock back an hour in October .
A lot of people are happy , because they can sleep ( for ) one hour more .
Hockey as a life style
Although all sports help you to have a healthy life , hockey provides you more than just being healthy or fit .
What are you thinking of whenever you choose a sport ?
You think that your life style will improve ?
Well you are mistaken .
For doing different kind of sports you need to be skilled or willing to try new things .
What if you do n't have none of those requierments ?
Then you know hockey is the aswner .
hockey is a sport I have played for many years and it turned out to be my favorite .
It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . in simple words ,
it 's a team sport .
However it 's not always as simple as it sounds .
You have to train five days a week and you need to concentrate a lot .
On the other hand I enjoy every second of it .
Through all my life I have been willing to improve in this sport and since 2010 it has became a life style to me .
Why will I recommend this to you ?
It would definitely help you to grow and improve as a person .
Hockey will change the way you see the world and you are going to start seen it with other eyes .
So stop searching for the right sport , this one is for you !
As far as I 'm concerned , public transportation is the best transport media for environmental care .
In spite of some people make enough money to buy their own car , electric and hybrid cars are more expensive than traditional ones ( the ones who use gas or diesel ) so , people choose this ones and that 's because pollution is several issue that we have to deal with .
The environmental care is taking strength every day , from kids too ancient people .
The government and many companies are measuring the CO2 emissions which are being produced by industrial or service processes that are necessary for producing goods for the social consume .
If people do n't use public transportation , they could walk , ride a bike or buy a traditional car , and that will probably take place when the destiny is far from the place where you live .
From my point of view , public transportation will be very important in the future , especially in developed countries .
I think the government will slow down the fee in public transportation , that could make people to use public transportation and caring the environment from CO2 emissions and prevent the global heating .
In Coslada City Council , people are well informed about taking care environment .
The city council has developed several campaigns to improve the awareness of its citizens , for example , the children learn at school how to separate the waste .
Each of them has three or four kinds of bins and they are not as far as two hundred meters .
There have been several planting campaigns to plant trees and to clean the river Jarama side .
Nevertheness it is never enough , because dog 's owners that they have most of the blame .
Since 2008 , there are many bike paths across the city , so the citizens will be able to avoid the car and they will emit less air pollution .
The organic waste is picked up every day and plastic and paper waste is picked up every other day .
The most important thing in the environment care is the education of children .
A problem which was caused by us , human beings , with their target of making money without thinking of the effects .
My family is very conscious of this trouble so we make any effort to solve it .
We usually use the public transport , which has a great quality in the city I live .
It works perfectly : it is always on time and the price is worth .
We live in a cottage and we have several bins which are clasified according to the material we want to recycle .
Moreover , we run an organization which pays people who bring us the materials to recycle .
The benefits are given to several organizations which take of care of the environment .
My sister teaches people what to do with things they want to rid of , such as bottles or papers .
She is able to do such beautiful jewellery that lots of people are following her !
It shows that this kind of things can have a second life .
As soon as the last river ends the southern border of Egypt is here .
The Nile river is the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization that counts over 6 thousand years .
All historians , researchers , scientists agree with this .
And as for me , I totally support their point of view .
Egypt is a kind of the river civilization among the huge desert Sahara .
All over the time the Nile is the only source of water for Egyptians .
Furthermore , elevation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possibility of expanding the area of fertile lands .
The Egyptians called their country ' Black Land ' to mark it off of the red soil of desert .
Nowadays , deep and wide valley of the Nile became the most important transport line for Egypt .
Through the centuries people have been exploring the nature of the Nile .
The ancient Egyptians divided the year for three seasons compared to dry or wet period .
They knew when it will be the ' Green Nile ' or ' Red Nile ' to stock up with clean water .
But such high level of development of Egyptian civilization has the negative side as well as positive .
The great amount of dams were built on the river that caused the disappearing of a lot of plants and animals .
Anyway , a lot of Egyptians still living far from the main water artery of the country and hardly can find the clean water to drink .
But I hope , as soon as Egypt become developing the government will pay attention to the ecological problems that high level .
When most people think about an important historical place in Italy , they think of Duomo , in Milano .
But the Duomo is not the most important .
I am sure you 'll agree that it 's the Colosseum .
For centuries this building had been the symbol of this city .
It quite ancient , but still fascinating for thousand of tourists , who come every year .
It was built in 79 A.C. by Tito , who was the Roman emperor .
It was used for shows with animals or humans , who were killed without pity .
Moreover navy wars were represented in order to celebrate Roman army .
It is ruined through the ages , but now people understand his importance and take care of it .
In my opinion it is important because it remembers our past and our traditions , which we should n't forget .
However not all people are aware of it .
That 's why it is important : it makes us understand to never give up and follow our dreams .
In this fast moving world transport has become an important factor for everyday activities .
Everybody needs a mode of transport to earn their daily living .
There is no point in saying public transport has no future .
Travelling through car is a convenient mode of transport , but most of the population can not afford it .
There are advantages and disadvantages in using a public transport .
Firstly to discuss the benefits of public transport it is cheap and affordable for all class of people in society .
Variety of buses are released by the government in order to meet people 's financial conditions .
Using public transport is a time waste and no privacy are some of the disadvantages .
Similarly travelling by car has its own advantage and disadvantages .
Everybody can not afford a travel through car as it is costly , but to discuss the benefits , one can enjoy high privacy during travel and is convenient
and sophisticated and can travel faster .
To sum up with it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because both has equal advantage and disadvantages .
Sometime I think that Taipei is too crowded .
There is no denying that the MRT in this city is such a convenient metropolitan system .
However , during the rush hour , there are always have such a ruin person who has no public awareness at all .
They occupy too many seats , inclouding priority seats .
Furthermore , most of them are students .
They do n't respect other passengers , just keep laughing and teasing each other , despite the fact that some people have told them not to do this .
Moreover , I think that provide the seat to elders is also a problem .
Priority seats , are preserved to those who need , not only elders but also some adult need it .
Somehow , not all of them can you identify whether their bodies feel uncomfortable merely from their appearance , which lead to Some misunderstanding between them .
Some people even blame them for they occupy the seats instead of offer the seat .
Moreover , some old people would take this considerative action for granted and they would even command young adults or students offer their seat without manners !
In my opinion , the transportation in our city have nothing to criticize expect that .
Everyone should develop the awareness of public manner .
Television is an important part of modern culture .
TV has much benefits :
Firstly it enables young people to share cultural experiences with others .
TV can act as a catalyst to get kids reading - following up on TV programs by getting books on the same subjects or reading authors whose work was adapted for the programs .
Television can teach kids important values and life lessons .
Educational programming can develop young children 's socialization and learning skills .
News , current events and historical programming can help make young people more aware of other cultures and people .
Documentaries can help develop critical thinking about society and the world .
TV can help introduce youth to classic Hollywood films and foreign movies that they might not otherwise see .
Cultural programming can open up the world of music and art for young people .
But television have also negative effects : First of all , children who spend a great deal of time watching television get less exercise .
In addition , these children receive less socialization with other children .
Television also takes away from family time .
This is also true for families who eat in front of the television .
I deal with consulting and sales of financial products and services to an international bank , in the mass - market and small - business .
I follow the relationship with customers from acquisition to the advise until the realization of contracts , building and maintaining relationships after - sales in the aim of customer satisfaction
I also worked with large and small teams in back - offices , managed many administrative activities related to mortages , personal loans , contability and investments too .

In many years of work I have honed my skills in managing non - standard situations , analyzing the problem , finding and implementing practical and easy solutions .
non - standard situations , analyzing the problem , finding and implementing practical and easy solutions .
I have faced several situations always work with serenity and enthusiasm , I like to work in a multicultural and dynamic .
I 'm careful to meet the goals of the team in which I work , cooperating with colleagues to achieve the goals by providing my skills , always willing to learn , respecting other points of view together finding ways to deal .
I work for the same large company for 25 years , now is the time to change and find new job opportunities .
Needs to work my husband has been living in Zaandam , I want to find a new job in Holland to rejoin our family .
I like sports such as skiing , riding and swimming . I 've also got the rescue licence , I worked as a lifeguard in the summer studying for the patent padi dive master
Nowadays we all hope , that public transport can save the world .
When we see all this cars in our yards , when we stay in traffic jam , we think that one day we will have to live our car and use public transport .
If we do n't do it , one day we 'll wake up in the immortal traffic jam .
But , probably , this situation is only period of development of transport .
We are told about a lot of innovations in this spheare .
For instance , Google reported about Googlemobile .
Maybe , robots will be able to drive more smart then people .
If they will contact each other and use Googlemap or something like that , they will be able to avoid accidents on the roads .
So people will be able to avoid traffic jams .
Not all people like the idea of Googlemobile .
Some people think , it might take away their independence .
But another of people think that it is not so bad idea , because they will be able to drink in spite of the fact , that they are drivers at the moment .
However , there will always be people who dislike to be a driver anyway .
And people who hate public transport , there will always be .
The question is , which sort of people have more impact in the world , and , finally , who will decide .
How many language do you speak ?
Did you ever think of learning another foreign language ?
Or do you want to be a polyglot ?
Today it is miles time important to learn a foreign language than before .
there are few reasons whcih show you why it is important to learn a foreign language today .
First , if you are planning to travel to another country , it is absolutely useful to speak local language , it makes your trip more easy and comfortable .
Second , for finding a good job opportunity , the business exchange is increasing in the intrenational level , if you speak a foreign language , certainly it adds some value on your profile and you can get a higher salary .
Third , through learning a foreign language , you do n't only learn a language , at the time you are also getting know its culture , get to know a different culture and society different than yours 's , it enriches your knowledge .
Over these years , there are more and more miserable accidents happened around the world .
From newspapers , magazines , even foreign medium , we can easily figure out that our environment is changing severely .
Many scientists infer that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years because of humans ' greedy .
Humans always desire to have a more convenient and comfortable life , but forget to protect and cherish the Earth at the same time .
High - technological countries have developed a great number of forests and lands to build high buildings .
Various factories emit excessive carbon dioxide into the air .
All the examples above will enhance the temperature and make the Earth hotter and hotter .
The higher temperature enhance , the worst the living quality is .
If people around the world could n't put more emphasis on our living places , we must have a dark and hopeless future .
Due to the climate change , the weather is so hot that people could even have a water shortage .
Losing enough water supply , people 's body will become weak and rough .
In this living situation , instead of laughter and happiness , there will be more fight , hatred and sadness .
Everyone lives in despair , but can not find the entrance to brightness .
The terrible consequences , are caused by the humans ' unsatisfied heart .
Friends , from now , let us be the members to protect and take care of our Earth !
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
The undercovered work is very hard , not just because you will work with dangerous people , the really danger is if you get discovered .
When people know that they were deceived , that they trust were broken , heads will roll .
You have to be precise , fast , and a really good actor .
The passion for the cause is the key to survive .
It is just something that I had to do , not you , not her , me .
I did n't choose that , this job has chosen me .

In our modern world , many people are suffered from stress that spring from life conditions .
In addition to this , people are working in very stressful workplaces and they want to leave from this condition in holidays .
Therefore , it can be said that holidays are the best option to renew the soul and revive the spirit for people .
In holidays , people can away from daily problems and also can take more time with their friends and family .
In this respect , many people prefer to go natural places with their families in order to forget about bad situations on their lives .
For example , walking in the seaside or swimming in the sea can be helpful to forget hard life conditions .
On the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking clearly their experinces about life .
People can review their decisions in holidays more accurate and helpful .
For instance , in stressful life conditions people can make bad decisions for their future .
Besides , people underestimate emotional feelings in their workplaces .
The reason is that people must complate their tasks in order to gain more money to maintain their lives and they forget about these emotional feelings such as love , helping people or thinking spiritual things .
It can be clearly seen that in holidays people are getting closer and they remember their feelings .
For example , people meet their relatives that never see for a long time .
At the same time , people have a chance to go sacred places in order to renew their spirits and souls .
They can pray for God and it gives a relief for people .
When people remember these emotional and spiritual subjects they can become more happy . Because people need to leave the material world .
In holidays , people have time to review their mistakes that leads to stressful life .
In conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people in order to heal their problems and stressful life conditions .
Also holidays are very helpful days in order to revive the spirit and the soul because people have a chance to move away modern life that has full of material subjects .
Cycling to school , to work or to do any other activity it is not a common habit in Spain .
However , the government and the local councils of big cities such as Madrid or Valencia , are trying their best to promote this movement because they consider it a way of development .
On the one hand , there are many benefits of cycling .
Firstly , it reduces traffic jams , noise and pollution , as well as it lowers CO2 emissions .
Furthermore , it turns out to be the quickest method of transport .
On the other hand , there are some issues such as the increase of danger on the roads .
Statistically cycling is generally considered to be more dangerous than travelling by car .
Another disadvantage is the weather .
Getting wet when it rains , having to do a lot of effort to cycle into a strong wind , freezing weather or having to keep drinking when hot weather .
In my point of view , Cycling contributes to improve community spirit and it is possible to look for solutions to face the disadvantages of this activity .
No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
For example , people taking car do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway .
And this undesirable time might be not so short during holidays , due to less frequent schedule .
Also , we can drive a car to any place where the public transport perhaps is not able not reach .
When the bus is crowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausting especially for a long distance .
Even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , advantages of travelling by public transport should not be neglected .
First , public transport is good for the environment compared to private car .
As we all know , the more public transport passengers use , the less car exhausts are emitted per person .
Recently , several studies have shown evidences that there is a strong relation between car exhausts and lung cancers .
In other words , public transport plays an important role in protecting human beings from suffering of diseases and saving life .
Second , public transport saves city spaces .
As more and more people choose to live in cities , nowadays our cities become larger and more crowded .
Correspondingly , the space for each person becomes more limited than before .
Provided that every citizen owns a car and use it rather than public transport for every travelling chance , I suppose that our streets would become a parking place and everyone would spend more time in congesting .
Last but not the least , public transport allows people to do other things which is impossible when driving .
The drivers have to continuously pay attention to surroundings , resulting in a tense spirit .
For a passenger , however , travelling is a complete relax .
People can listen to music , take a phone call with a friend , read a fascinating book or just loot at outside .
Though there are many advantages for public transport , it does not mean that public transport is the best choice for every situation .
E.g. , it offers less flexibility than cars , and is less environment friendly than bicycles .
Therefore , it is unreasonable to conclude that one transport can replace others .
It is better that people are aware of their pros and cons and choose a fit one .
Languages for the future
Should learn other languages ? .
We live in a world that day to day changes and people need to develop their skills and overcome .
I think there are many reasons to learn languages .
On the one hand it could allow you to communicate with people , know different cultures and travel around the word without the language barrier .
Also in recent years to express yourself in English , French , Germany and Russian has became something essential and very important in our lives to find a job .
I think a great disadvantage is the price of the course .
Also I consider that it tends to be hard and takes time away from doing any other things .
It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitability in the future but to achieve it the will have to be motivated and to enjoy learning .

Today , I went to my Winnie 's home with Adriana in the afternoon .
We ate delicious food and play interesting games altogether .
We had a great time .
At 2 o'clock in he afternoon , we arrived at Winnie 's home .
First , we listened to some songs , such as almost and big big world .
After thirty minutes , we had tea .
Winnie loves eating very much so I can easily find much food at her home .
We had mouth- watering strawberry cakes and juicy apple juice for tea and they were extremely yummy .
After having tea , we play hide - and - seek altogether in Winnie 's garden .
Adriana and I hid behind a bench and Winnie looked for us .
Suddenly , Winnie fell over a little stone .
Adriana and I immediately came to her and held her up . '
Your knee is bleeding .
Are you okay'I asked .
I was shaking like a leaf and my heart is pounding since I was worried about Winnie .
I had butterflies in my stomach.'Yes , I am fine , ' Winnie replied .
I felt relieved then .
Then , Adriana found a plaster and put it on Winnie 's wound .
Winnie felt warm inside and smiled happily .
I felt glad today although Winnie hurt herself .
Why ?
It is because our friendship is more rugged .
What an unfoggetable day !
In my opinion the house in the future will be better .
House of the future will be big and bright .
Inside will be full of conveniences .
Big spaces will be divided in a few zones .
Relaxation 's , learning 's , kitchen 's zones and so on .
In house of the future there will be automatic curtains reacting to the light in every house .
Every house will be flexible .
Thanks to that it can expand or reduced .
Everything depends on the number of people .
Swimming is my favourite sport .
Why do I like swimming ?
Well , swimming has always been an Olympic sport , it is an individual sport so it depends entirely on the swimmer 's efforts , but you can also enjoy teamwork when you participate in swimming competitions .
It is a sport that requires a lot of fitness , it is a sport that can be learnt at any age but children can start to learn swimming as early as two years of age .
Swimming has different types ; dolphin , crawl , backstroke and breast stroke .
Swimming as a sport is very useful in wieght reduction if you are obese and need to reduce your wieght , it is also the best sport for the asthmatic patients because it strengthens the chest muscles and decreases the vulnerability of those patients to respiratory infections .
If you will start to learn swimming , choose a place that has an experienced coach , and try to be part of a group of your age .
Hello Paul ,
I enjoyed helping at the concert which was in Antaya on October .
I had a great time with people who are working as a helper for the concert .
I got a lot of experience from them .
In the concert time all people can enjoy but nobody think about how they are preparing to concert .
I saw so many interesting things during the preparetion time .
For example they know everything about each helper 's jobs but on the same time they just concern own subjects .
I want explain to you some interesting part from my experience .
In the concert morning were excited and thinking about the concert and we decided do not think about the concert just do your job which would be given .
When we were arranging concert plan we made work sharing for all of us .
Some of them started design the stage , some of them checking songs volume and lights .
My job was checking songs list which singers would perform .
I think it was the most difficult part of the concert because of singers .
They were always wanted to change some songs which was on the list .
On the concert time I was really worried that something would appear suddenly .
Actually everybody can be worried because they gave time and effort for it .
Finally concert started and all the lights were shining like stars .
It is difficult to explain that feeling .
When the concert finished I felt like a bird which flying freely .
Of course I had some pain in my legs because all the time I was standing .
However , I like to be a volunteer on enjoyable projects .
I want to invite you to our next concert which will be next month if you have any time please come and see how we are preparing for the concert .
I am waiting for your email .
See you !
Technology is changing the way we live in many ways and how we receive and use information is probably the most affected .
Regarding advertisement , technology is having a huge , and not always possitive impact on outdoor advertisement .
From black - and - white adds posted in public places we have moved to practically live surrounded by outdoor adds placed in every available and imaginable spot .
From buildings with enormous and bright screens to interactive bus stop signs .
The recent developments in mobile technology allows advertisers to offer personalized publicity to each of us .
I''m sure that in the very near future , if I have been looking for restaurants in Mallorca in my computer or mobile at home , in my way to work the adds on the buses i will see - which of course will be screens and not printed paper - will show images of Mallorca , or an add from tripadvisor with Mallorca in it .
It will suit me sometimes , and it even will be useful , but I 'm also sure sometimes I will find it aggresive .
The way it feels aggresive to enter a square or plaza in my town and find it full of bright screens , no matter how beautiful or artistic the pictures displayed are .
Advertisement might be considered an art , or at least some pieces are really artistic , but placed on the wrong spot or showed at the wrong time they loose they artistic side .
But , technology is hre for best or worst , and we have to learn to deal with it the best we can .
If I could change one thing in my life , I would like to change my house .
I 'd like to have a big detached house in sububs of Artem or Vladivostok .
So that I could live more freely and independently .
If I had this house , I would decorat it in modern stayl .
I would build there fitness gym , wardrobe -room , swimming pool .
If I had such house , I would like to equip a barbecue area in my garden .
I could invite my friends and relativs .
Together we could spend time in pleasant atmosphere .
When it comes to my favorite sport , tennis will always be my answer .
Though I am a beginner of it , I think it 's interesting since it requires a lot of skills to be a master of it , which sounds very challenging .
When I feel stressed off , I always play tennis to release my pressure .
If you are a beginner of tennis , my advice is that you need to get a suitable rocket for you first .
As the proverb goes : If you want to learn something well , you would need to get the right tools first to work on it .
Next , you are required to learn every basic skills step by step .
Since tennis requires lots of basic skills , if you do n't learn these important technical slowly and steadily , you may get hurt during the practice .
Finally , finding a good teacher is is also critical .
A skilled coach can teach you the best skills of tennis .
Do we have better television than a few decades ago ?
Do we have enough choices in the screen ?
Can you imagine having only two channels and not playing the whole day ?
That was only 30 years ago .
An explosion of channels arrived to our houses in the eighties .
In this report we will see some characteristics of today 's television .
Number of Channels are gradually reducing
In our country one decade ago when digital TV arrived , a lot of new channels flourished .
All tv tried to get several licences to distribute their shows .
In order to resolve some deficits budgets , today there are mainly two TV groups .
Less channels means less choices .
Internet TV is increasing
It costs less money and you can choose exactly the moment , where and with who watching this or that televison program .
You just follow a suggestion made bay someone .
You just click on it .
They have to reduce their budget
Despite of changing channels we see the same news .
Big Broadcast groups are used by all of them .
It is expensive to keep journalists and camera all around the world .
It is cheaper to buy it .
Summary
TV is dying .
It is hard to compete with the Internet .
Nowadays only national or international broadcast groups can be in the match .
Perhaps political reasons help to maintain such a budget deficit .
However the fact is that there is a countdown on them .
Dear Mrs Hopkins ,
I have seen your advertisement in the newspaper and I am writing to express an interest
to join your small group on a trip around the world .
I am a 20-year - old student from Switzerland speaking German , French and English and I am keen on travelling .
With several trips to many countries I have made until now , I would say that I have already some experience in travelling around the word .
I am interested in to join your group , because I like meeting new people from other countries and I would like to explore new countries around the world .
For ten years I have been in a scout group in which I have learnt a lot about different kinds to find a way or to orientate myself in the wilderness .
Furthermore I feel suitable to join your group because I like travelling and I would like to be a part of your adventure .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Dear Steve ,
It was good to hear from you .
Basically my idea is to use this trip to learn as much as possible , I mean , not only the English language but also to know more about your culture and visit nice places of your country as well .
As I told you before I ca n't afford to pay this trip alone , so my father will put up some money to help me .
But I wanna find a job to help him with the bills .
Can you give me a hand on it ?
You can also help me to find a cheap place to rent .
It will be helpful if you find a small apartment near the Cambridge University where I 'll study English for 5 months .
Thanks for all your help and I look forward to hearing from you .
Best wishes
João Matos
Hi John ,
I am looking forward to seeing you .
First of all , you should get outside of the airport terminal .
There you will see bus stations in the street .
When you get there take the bus which has number 111 .
Then ride to the bus stop " Zličín " .
There you can get to the underground station and travel to the centre of Prague .
If you choose this way , I 'll call you in the morning to tell you where will we meet exactly .
But if I were you I would take a taxi for the underground is quite boring , but it is cheaper .
Anyway , you need to get to the centre . I 'll wait for you there .
Finally , the weather forecast for next month looks pleasantly as it is usual at this time of year .
That 's why you do n't have to take warm clothes .
I am delighted to see you soon .
Best wishes ,
Jacob
In my opinion we should go to the restaurant because all people need a relaxing moment for doing work better than before .
Firstly , we can discuss type of food we want to eat .
Actually , students eat a lot fast food while they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to do food , for these reasons I think that the best restaurant is somowhere when they do home - made food , and a good idea is for mains course : baked potatoes , steamed vegetables and for dessert apple cake .
On the other hand , we are studying architecture maybe we should choose a special restaurant , I like a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of windows , with a white chair , table and wall , more or less a relaxing environment but the atmosphere is very important for dinner and I think that we must vote this , because we will have a good night or not depending the type of atmosphere we choose .
In conclusion , I think that this type of food and atmosphere is very for us , because normally we had spoken about book , work and studies , while with this type of environment we can speak about us , our family , our hobbies and all people get to know new something about other mates .
I would like to go to Foster 's Hollywood .
I love the food here and I think my classmates too .
You can it the best burgers you have ever eaten .
They are incredibily delicious .
I do not know how do they make and cook them .
These burgers are my favourite food because they are amazing .
I can not say how they are because you have to taste them .
It is a flavour similar to stay in the heaven or in the paradise .
I recommend you to go to this restaurant and you definitely leave with a very good flavour in your mouth and a huge smile in your face .
You will want to come another time .
However , if you do not like burgers you can eat whatever you want of American food and you will get the same fantastic opinion as a person who has eaten another meal .
Public transport plays an important role in our modern day lives .
More than a billion people use buses , taxi 's and trains etc as tourists , for work , meeting relatives , going to school etc .
Many even use cars .
That is why because the cost of petrol , diesel and gas is quite high in most of the countries of the world .
While travelling by public transport can save a lot of money in following ways :
1 . People can save the money they spend on petrol .
2 .
As they have specific routes across the country , town , city and villages , it helps people to spend less in shops or restaurants on highways or even inside the city etc .
I disagree with the statement stated above because in future we are likely to have only two classes in society , the rich and the poor .
Middle class is disappearing and becoming scarce day by day .
It is because of high taxes on goods .
So , I believe either we will have public transport or people are going to be as they were in the stone age .
Public transport is even good for our environment rather than cars .
Nowadays people have different views about reading books and watching movies .
Some of them think that books are more interesting than them film versions .
I agree with this point of view .
I tend to think that there is nothing better than reading a book .
Firstly , reading helps to become a well Educated Person and give a chance to develop knowledge .
That 's why while you are reading you are getting a piece of information .
Furthermore , books develops imagination of reader .
When you are reading a picture of what is happening appears in your mind .
You can imagine how heroes look Like , you can imagine different views , where the action takes place .
And finally , I think it 's very important that you can easily take your book with you and start reading anytime you want .
On the other hand , if you like being in company the best way for you is movies .
Because you can watch it with your friends .
Also many people choose movies because they like soundtracks and special effects .
It 's so exciting .
but all these factors are not important for me .
I suppose that books are better than them film version .
To sum up , I 'd like to say reading is really great thing .
A girl was walking home one day .
She was with her mum ..
She was just a young beautiful girl !
So , they were going home when the girl noticed a cute doll in a shop .
She had blond hair and she was wearing a blue dress , white gloves and black shoes .
Just like her ... ''Mum I love this doll!Could you bye it for me ? '' she said .
Her mum could n't deny to her , so she bought it .
Oh!The girl had so many special moments with her doll!!They looked so adorable together!They were like twins !
After some years the girl decided that she had to move .
She was eighteen years old , she had to be indepedent .
So she took a deep breath and put her doll in the attic just like her childhood memories .
At night she heard some creepy noises from there ...
She went there and thera was the doll with a knife in her hand.''Bell , why you do n't play with me anymore?Are you boring of me?Just because I have only one eye?But you removed me the other one .
Just because I do n't have one if my gloves?But you did it again!''she screamed .
And then ...
Next day , going at her home her mum wanted to find her daughter .
So , she went upstairs ...
The girl had a knife in her kneck and on the wall there was a sentence,''Why did you leave me that way ? ''
Tennis is an individual sport .
Just you have to deal with the game .
You can choose lots of places to play .
You need a good pair of shoes , a tennis racket and some balls and person who play with .
Although you should be good at playing backhand or forehand , you can lose finally .
This sport is not just about a physical power .
You supposed to use your brain as well .
It is combination of a physical power , a technique and a mental power .
As the other sports , tennis is getting more modern , fast and commercial .
I mean professional tennis .
Some children wanted to play tennis because of money or glory .
Some of them practise tennis because of their parents .
It is not fair enough .
Children should play games , not just tennis , because it is fun , it develops their skills , helps to physical health and so on .
You can start if you are grown up anyway .
It is never too late .
Either you can find a professional coach or just join your friends .
Enjoy !
Dear Mrs Kate Ashby ,
My name is Andrea Cocci , I 'm sixteen , and I saw the advertisement of the weekend work in your cafe , and I 'm interested to work with you .
I ' m the perfect choice for this work , in fact , I 'm interested in different kinds of food because I am Italian , and for us food is everything .
In Italy , I attend school for waiter and cook , and sometimes I cook lasagna , pasta , pizza and many other specialties of my country , and I was assumed in many famous restaurant .
I"m also good at dealing with people , in fact since when I was younger , I have done the animator at the summer camp of Alpignano , the city where I lived , and I spent a lot of time with children and adults .
I also worked for many theater companies and I am so good and kind when I talk with other people , also if I do n't know them .
At the end , I 'm also prepared to work long hours , when I worked with my aunt in his cafe , I worked from eight a.m. and I lasted at 9 p.m. , it was difficult but I did it all days .
I look forward to hearing from you soon ,
Andrea Cocci
Essay
In today 's essay I am going to focus on the pros and cons of studying English abroad .
Is it really worth leaving your own country for a period of time to study English ?
Talking with English native speakers is always a good thing because you will be able to judge how well or badly you are doing .
Besides , it can be funny and enjoyable if you plan it properly .
However , you will have to spend a considerable amount of money in it and you will not be assured to achieve your goals at all so it would be able to become a real nightmare if you are not focus on your learning tasks .
From my point of view I think the advantages overcome the disadvantages especially if you have some money saved for it .
But if you do not , there is always a solution which is using the Internet to learn everything you need .
You can even talk with native speakers by using some Chat Rooms online such as Skipe and others .
Football , a passion
When I was little I had tried a lot of sports , Handball , Swimming , Tennis , but my favourite sport is not one of those , it is a sport that I have never imagine : Football .
All my life I thought that football was a sport which was for men , not for girls , but once I tried it , I loved it .
Have you ever think about playing football ?
At first , when I started to play football I did it with my classmates , who where all boys , so I used to feel a little bit uncomfortable , however , some years ago , they started to intergrate me when they play , and nowadays , I love playing football with them .
Now , some women and I started to organize female matches , so I am more used to play with girls . I never imagine that I was going to be so keen on football , but now it takes part of my life .
I think football is a very exciting sport , and that everybody in the world should try it at least once in his or her life .
One thing you should keep in mind if you want to play football is that you have to be ready to reacive some punches .
I recommend you a great restaurant which is in the shopping center .
I have been there twice , and I like it .
Its name is " The English oven " , and it 's a fantastic traditional and modern restaurant with British food .
The service is excellent and the waiters are so pleasant and gentle .
The interior is big , so all the class could stay inside without problems .
The decoration is modern and cozy , and it 's got some great traditional British objects .
The food is one of the best things in the restaurant that is always tasty and fresh .
The've got a lot of different dishes , traditional and modern .
They have also got a lot of different types of salads , pasta and pizzas .
The desserts are very good too .
They 've got original ones , like sweet pizza , and traditional .
There is a big variety of ice creams .
This restaurant is not too expensive , which is perfect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much money .
The restaurant is in the shopping center , so we can get there by bus or by train .
I think this is the best restaurant to go on the end of the course , so we could book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually goes there .
During whole life , famous people , such as politicians and film stars , media are accompanying them .
In my view , public person deserve to have their own life , without photographing .
In one hand , becoming a public person associate with jornalist , mass - media , flashes .
Famous people are obligated to provide their life in exemplary way .
However , they still being ordinary people , they make mistakes .
People are thought being jealous .
Notice any kind of failures .
It seems to me that journalist might be absolutely toxic and they have defective infulence on society which assess celebrites through the prism of journalistic documentary .
In the other hand many of stars sold their privacy to earn more and more money .
The value of their talent , abilities are counted in amonut of tabloids scandals .
Summing up , all over the world , are living famous people who do n't bring into the limelight their life .
It has ever been very useful for a long time ago , nevertheless nowadays , there are some people who ask if the public transport was suppressed , and society would save a lot of money .
However , people should think about the large advantages , such as : people save money ; it is very comfortable and good for the environment .
Firstly , the main reason is the cost because the people who do not have a car they need to travel or commute to another place and a car is very expensive .
The cars need to be repaired ; besides , if you have a car , you have to pay some taxes .
In addition , these people need to have public transport for travelling around the country and city .
Secondly , another reason is the global warming because the atmosphere is much polluted .
If you use the public transport , you can be less contaminating than before because there are a lot of people who travel together in only one transport .
Finally , the last reason is the comfort because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the centre of the city .
Besides in some cities , car can not be parked in some places , such as : the old city and the city centre .
Summing up , people are aware of global warming and think about the high cost of having a car .
From my point of view , I get used to walking around my city and my car is just used if I travel around the country .
We are living in a ever changing world .
Today 's new things become things of past in few months .
Take an example of mobile technology , your latest handset , with latest configurations becomes outdated within few months after buying it .
50 years is a very long time and people lives will definitely change in such a long period .
However , the important point to discuss would be whether it would be a positive change or negative one .
Last 50 years science and technology took great leaps , internet , mobiles made us more connected .
Today , we have all the information at finger - tips .
Today , we do n't need to worry about getting lost at new place , Google maps are always there to help .
We need not to cram English words today , as we can quickly find meaning of any word on our mobiles .
Meeting new people or selling your products , you do nt need to face anyone , everything can be managed through a virtual platforms .
Today our lives have become much more comfortable than past , thanks to progress mankind has made in technology .
On the other hand a number of terrorism , global warming and greed became top challenges of today 's world .
Climate changes due to global warming causing natural disasters now and then .
Terrorist activities causing havoc in public live .
Corruption and greed of people in power making it difficult to trust people leaders .
If these challenges are not addressed in coming years , imagining better lives for people in 50 years hence is rather difficult .
We need to remember technology is just a tool , in right hand it would be boon for us , in wrong hands it has power to destroy the world as we see it today .
to who may concern ,
I 'm an Italian girl who 's studying to improve her English . I 've got a positive and energetic personality .
I read your advertisement on your website and I immediately thought " That 's for me , I 'm the right person for this kind of job ! " .
Perhaps , you 're wondering why I should be the right person .
That 's soon said .
I 'm motivated , flexible and openminded person and I had a lot of experience in this field as well .
I 've worked as social trainer and as educators since I was 16 .
I love doing social activities and planning events .
When I worked as educator , I used to plan and manage some sports and outdoor acitivities .
I had a very great memories of these experiences and I would really like to live them again .
If you are interested , please have a look at my CV .
As you requested , I attach it in this mail .
Best regards .
Personally , mobile phones are very important in my life .
I need that device near me because I have three children and I want to know how and where they are .
The same about my parents ; they are old and sometimes they call me for talk about their healht .
Concerning video - games , I agree with scientits that they thought its help children 's brain to develop , but is important controller them because there are a lot violent games .
However there are brilliant games for children .
In my opinion , the Internet is absolutely a revolution in current society .
It is very common to use the Internet in my work for research or google information and also connect whit other teachers , speak about courses and change information .
Finally , I think technological developments make us improve to the future .
Friends should be like a shadow always beside you .
In the time of joy and sorrow .
Nothing is impossible in life but not doubt it is not easy to find sincere friends .
It does not mean you will never find one .
It is very important to interact and socialise with people to make a friend .
The more people you will meet the more easy it will become for you to find a friend .
When you find one spend time with them , share views , ideas and go out with them .
Friends do not have to agree on everything you say but they should share their views about it .
The Guardian is a British daily newspaper which includes national and international news .
You could find a variety of articles such as politics , Business and Money , sports , culture , education , Life and style , Travels , the weather and the Environment .
there are plenty of advertisements for jobs and donations to help individuals .
readers are able to express their opinion freely .
they use a quality English language which avoids slang language .
As result , it is suitable for students who learn English Language to improve their English .
On the other hand , I realised there were two disadvantages .
For example , it is not suitable for children due to official Language . there were also a huge number of commercials advertisements which make the readers bored .
Overall , The Guardian is considered one of the best newspapers in the world .
Nowadays , in the modern and progressive world where people are smart and economy very highly developed .
Some people think that we need in tablet computers instead books
In my opinion , the problem is very interesting .
Sometimes then I am watching TV or I am reading newspaper I notice that gadgets become very useful for our life .It seems to me good opportunities to make our life more easily .
Also it makes us more clever .
I am convinced that using tablet computers in our everyday life is rather good .
People do not need to carry a lot of books in a bag .Pupil could not say that he left a book because he has all books in his tablet computers
Some people think that it is a bed idea .
They believe that it is useless thing for our generation .
Such people are sure that electronic things make us stupid .
They insist on not using tablets at school .
Personally for me , I like books very much .when I at home I use books because I like to smell and to touch the paper of books .
I do not agree with the people who think that tablets are useless .
We should use it but we are must not forget about books .
In conclusion , I want to say that that we should keep abreast of new technologies and try to make our lives easier
The Big Mistake
This day was full of joy and happiness , but something went wrong after when she told him that she is pregnant .
She was so happy about this news and she thought that he will be happy as well , but ...
At the moment when she told him that she is pregnant , he just frozen .
It was too much for him .
He thought it 's easier to walk away and avoid this conversation with her .
He tried to understand what 's going on with him .
It was weird how many questions and doubts came up on his head .
One part of him was really happy , because to be a father is his one of the biggest dream , but on the other hand he could n't handle this news .
This woman , who stands next to him , is his girlfriend , his future wife .
He should be happy and hug her and celebrate this good news .
But somehow he did n't feel anything .
All that he felt was anxiety .
He could n't handle the feeling , when she tried to touch him , to kiss and hug him .
He knew that she loves him as much as he loves her , but everything was just too wrong on this moment .
Her voice , her smile and even her body was to wrong on this moment .
She could n't understand what 's going on , because it was just three weeks ago when they had a conversation about kids and family and he said that he would like to have kids with her .
And now , he just avoids her and he is not happy about the news .
It was a big mess .
She was more than happy and he could n't handle this news .
They both knew that they love each other and they care about each other , but it was too much for him .
He stood up and said to her girlfriend that he needs a break and he have to be alone .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
To the beginning I am going to take about what is my lovely sports and why I will enjoy the sport .
In fact , I do not like to do some sports during the anytime , but if I really need do some exercises that I like to go to swim in the swimming pool .
Firstly , I think , swimming pool is clearing .
Such as after swimming that I have a safe and a bathroom to take shower .
Secondly , I do not like to go to beach , this is because I do not like big sun and sand .
Third , swimming in the ocean is most dangerous .
However , I like to stay in the swimming pool during the summer .
Actually , I do not know how to swim but it is my favorite sport in my whole life .
Moreover , I think before any kind of sports that we should do some exercises that is because we need to relax our bodies first . If we do not do it that we will get dangerous while we are doing any sports .
In conclusion , my opinion is I do not like to do any sports but we need to choose one kind of sport in our life and almost all people need to do it , as we could not stay at home or working all the time .
Even you really do not like to do exercise that you can go to shop .
The purpose of this report is to outline the most important actions which have been taken in our town to protect the environment as the main issue to improve our quality of life .
In the first place , we need to pay attention to the fact that Caceres is located in a pasture area where local farmers have been breeding sheep , cows and pigs for centuries in spite of the hard weather conditions such as high temperatures and terrible drought in summer .
As a result , our water resources are difficult to be preserved and it is clearly necessary to maintain active campaigns to raise people 's awareness about the importance of a rational use of it .
The local government is also taking strong action on creating green areas in different places in or around the town where citizens can spend their free time or even do sports .
That 's the reason why it has been working on the recovery of some areas which are now parks or recreational areas .
Finally , the town has also improved the management and treatment of waste system with the active cooperation of most of the citizenship who is really concerned about the recycling of waste need .
In fact , around 90% of Caceres inhabitants are said to sort and recycle their rubbish taking it out to the yellow , green and blue containers in every street .
And that is the negative point , these dumpsters are too visible in town and it would be advisable to change the ones we have for underground ones .
I woke up today and I just remember that I was doing a presentation about landscapes , and the ones that do it will reward a bonus point but anyways this is n't important information .
I searched my family in the house and there was no one in the home , just me .
I get a bit scared so I search them outside in the streets .
I did n't knew that a bomb hit on the city and killed almost everyone , now I have to find my parents .
I think the reason why I did n't know about the explosion is because this part where I live is a very poor area and it 's not that beautiful so you ca n't distinguish were does the explosion hit .
Finally in some days I found some neighbors with some food , I was starving to death so I ate a lot .
We made some incentives about laws , but it was a total conflict , because the group noticed that some food was missing somehow .
I think that someone drags some of the food on the night while everybody is sleeping .
So everybody is gon na try to enforce the laws .
In the next morning I ate a piece of steak and the group was talking about some creatures that were walking around to kill and eat us .
In the night I was thinking about many things just when I heard some noises .
I stalked him and it seemed that this guy has a hump .
I stomp him and when he turned around it was a woman from the group .
We were talking about this when a dog just came near ; it was adorable just when he converted into a big weird creature .
He bit my leg and it hurt a lot , we tried to alert the others but it was too late , it was the group or us .
We saw that beast eating our friends and the food .
In some ways that she robbed the food in the night and I wake up it was good for my survival .
But if I had the opportunity to reverse the trend of how am I going I would not do it because I have to face all of this .
DOING EXCERCISE IS GOOD FOR YOURE HEALTH
Why do you have to exercise ?
What benefits do you obtain while exercising ?
Do you know that 75% of people in Mexico , does n't practice any type of exercise , this is a big problem to our society and is the problem number 1 of why Mexico is the country with more obese in the world .
Doing excercise it 's an important thing to do in a healthy and happy life , while you excercise you feel well with you re self an you re body .
There 's a lot of benefits that come in hand with doing excercise like reducing or take control of you re weight , it helps you with heart disease , problems with you re body , and also you can make a lot of friends while doing any exercise .
Now days there 's a lot of different types of exercising , you can practice any sport , like soccer , basketball , baseball , or you can simply go to the GYM or practise Crossfit or something like that .
Soccer it 's a great sport where you can make a lot of friends , you can stay fit , but you also need some skills because it 's not easy to controll the ball and dribble you 're rivals on the field .
I recommend you to practise any sport you like and enjoy every second you spend exercising .
Thanks and start now , you wo n't regret it .
Is there any future to public transport , for travelling by car is much more convenient ?
Many disagree about the public transport whom are to be disappearing , though we still have to deal with different opinions about increasing in travelling .
This composition will explain the two different opinions .
Firstly , the car is more convenient because there is privacy .
Also , unlike public transport such as buses and underground , you have much more comfort and speed .
There is a perception that a car can give you the freedom of choice .
On the website of The Scottish Government ( publication " Young people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 years old boy explain « - I prefer going in the car , it 's quicker ...
There 's not as many people around you ... I prefer the car because you can listen to music as well . »
Although they are many positive points about private cars , they are also negative ones .
Indeed , cars increases the pollution , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensive . « - On my wage , even the driving lessons are expensive .
Then just owning a car and looking after your car , insurance , tax , etc .
Obviously it would benefit me if I worked in Edinburgh , but I do n't work in Edinburgh .
» says a 17 - 22 years old boy .
Now , secondly , travelling by public transport is cheaper ( we do n't pay any fees on public transport , but also , it is safer ,
According to The Saigon Times , there are a lot of traffic accidents which occurred to private cars .
The main reason is that the cars ' owners are drunk when driving .
It is clear that if they took a bus or a taxi when they were drank , it would not have as much accidents .
Finally , many developed countries on the world , such as England , America , Canada , Japan and so on , have built a public transport system , so the traffic jam have been decreased .
As a result , the economy has been increasing .
From this analysis , it isobvious that travelling by public transport is very important .
Topic :
Do you agree or disagree " Always telling the truth is considered the most important thing in a relationship " ?
Disagreement on always telling the truth be the most important point in a relationship will be my opinion .
Even though being truthful is crucial in relationship , always telling the truth would be considered as hurting others ' feelings and is unwise .
Another reason for not telling the truth all the time is if it is about personal matter and it would feel like awkward to mention to colleagues or the employer .
It is better to tell a little white lie at this moment .
To further illustrate the first point above , could hurt one 's feelings by telling the truth at all time .
For example , if some woman you are acquainted wearing inappropriate clothes not fitting in the occasion .
People usually tend not telling her the truth since it could make her feelings .
Instead of doing so , people may praise her with other things on her .
In that case , they could still make conversions without boiling her mood .
The other point is when it comes to personal matters , people usually intend to keep it private since most of the time it is strange and inappropriate to talk oneself too much to people at work or even people that one just got acquainted .
If there are questions about things one do not want other people to know , they might say a little white lie which usually does not matter too much .
If I was having a day off to go to a doctor , I would prefer other people from asking details about it by say that I just had some errands to run .
These are the two opinions of mine on telling the truth or not .
Last Friday , Michael and I was in the school playing happily with each other in the classroom .
When we were in the class , suddenly Michael walked towards the door .
Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he made a mistake .
Due to this , we're both called to meet the headmaster .
I could n't understood why we needed to meet the headmaster just because Michael had closed the door .
The door was n't broke into pieces or fell down .
My curiosity had put me into a big trouble .
I asked the headmaster in a polite way and hopefully he can gave me the answer I wanted .
However , things do n't happened like what I hoped .
I ended getting expelled from the school because teacher and the classmates suspected Michael and I steal our classmate - Sally 's wallet .
I could n't imagine the teacher and friends also pointed at us firmly and without given any chance for us to speak out .
I finally realised that everything was a trap and we 're the unlucky and innocent ones as we fell into the trap .
We wiped off our tears , and waved our hands when we left the school .
Although , one day later the headmaster found out the truth through CCTV , but we refused to return to the school and decided to change a new school as we know even if we go back this time , similar cases could happen next time .
This is because the teacher has a biased mindset .

Day number 8 .
We were ready to go and find the others , we went outside the shelter we built and write in wall near to the shelter " safe zone " and if there is someone that needs supplies he would find some supplies and ammo to survive .
We start our journey and going in the forest , there was a lot of # pests on our way there were various guys that were sick we could n't do anything except for , keep going , I was seeing my little group to # diminish and some of us were # allergic to some plants , I was the only one that had no problem with all the other stuff people had problems with .
I thought that maybe my # genes were actually immune to the infection I could actually be the # revolutionary guy that helps everyone that was in my # skeptick and I was really positive about it but # notwithstanding , I would n't actually sacrifice myself I have to think about is it help the entire world or just save a group the decision was in my hands it was # conventional to help the entire world but I do n't want to die . while I was thinking about that we found a body it was a familiar body from someone that was in the group one of those guys we wanted to find and alive not dead his face was all rotten and eaten away by the walkers .
We needed to find the ones that were still alive or at least tells us what happened to everyone , the # battle against hunger started everyone was hungry and we haven't eaten anything in a few days and that could lead us to two things dead or eaten away by a walker so we needed to find something that was a # nutritional based food where we could eat with no problem and be ok .
We found a pharmacy and a restroom where we could get a rest and take a shower to clean ourselves .
We got close to the pharmacy there was no walkers inside so we run into the pharmacy and closed all the doors and I got someone to check us in the night I needed some rest and went to sleep immediately .
In my area there are many railway lines and they 're often overcrowded .
But private traffic in this town is yet more present , as the result that Turin is the town of FIAT , the well known factory .
Near to your home , there are many supermarkets in which you can easily buy all that you need to live .
When you have to pay the telephone and energy bills , you can do that in any tobacco shops near to your home .
If you like shopping , in the perimeter of the town , there are some big supermarkets , which hold many items of the main great factories of Europe and above .
Like all the industrialised countries , a connection to the Internet is granted almost for each area and each building .
At the end , the taxi are present and they cover all the town , but this service is less organised and developed than the English one .
There is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , film stars , politicians or people who work in music industry deserve to have a private life , deserve not to be under constant observation .
To my mind there should be a board between paparazzi work and a privacy of famous people .
In my opinion big stars should be able to relax and take some private time .
As far as I 'm concerned there is no one who feels comfortable when is under surveillance of people who wait to take pictures which shows them in embarrassing situation .
Unfortunately , this is a part of celeb 's ' work ' so they have to take into account .
But on the other hand , there should be some inviolability spheres of life without journalists following them all the time .
This rarely fragments of life without an eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live like normal , not famous people .
I know that catching celebrity doing celaning or taking a dog for a walk is a shocking news for people who read tabloids .
To my mind , they do not believe celebs are such a normal people as everyone of us only with more money in theirs bank accounts
So , as you can see I agree with the statement that famous people , who are recognizable , deserve to have a privte life and the ability of having normal life should be also given to them .
The Maze Runner
I recently watched this new film based on one of the books of this worldwide known author .
As I have an interest in thrillers , I decided to give it a try .
The poster of the film already offered a sense of intrigue and mystery which made me take the decision to watch this film .
The film starts by putting yourself in the flesh of the main character , which is a 16-year - old boy who finds himself imprisoned in a cage and being transported to what it seems to be a camp .
He has no idea how he ended up there .
However , he soon realizes that this is not a normal camp , which is located next to a giant and mysterious maze .
The people who lives in the camp take up different roles in order to survive and defend themselves from the menaces of the maze .
He took the role of a runner , the people responsible for exploring the maze and look for an exit of this place .
Still , they only have the daylight time to explore the maze , as when the sun goes down it becomes very dangerous .
The film keeps getting better and better as you watch it , having its exciting moments when the characters discover something that hidden inside the maze .
I heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to have a rush of adrenaline while enjoying a solid story which will leave no one indifferent .
I 've been playing volleyball for 12 years now and hopefully many more , what I love about it is first of all that tall or small , anyone could play it as long as they 're determined so basically is a life long sport for everyone .
I love the speed of volleyball , most of the time it 's quick and if you blink you probably missed something , each contact happens in less than a second , and still every player directs the location of the ball in that amount of time and then there 's the intensity , if you haven't seen a game go until 32 - 30 , and see the energy on the floor and hear the noise from the crowd you 're missing out .
Personally winning such a set makes me feel like I could do anything , but when I do n't , it still keeps me wanting more .
I am always trying to jump higher , hit harder , pass and set better , and serve in more different ways .
I live in New Eltham .
My area is very clean and very green .
People there are very friendly and helpful .
It is a good place to live .
One time per week on Wednesday , robbish are taken .
Of course garbage is sorted into different bins .
That is very good idea , because that robbish undergo a recycling .
All my neighbors in the same way collected garbage .
Every body care about cleanlinees in the front of the house and in the garden .
Especially spring is a lot of colours and pleasant odors .
New Eltham have beautiful parks where you can relax from the busy place .
Green time in my town is really fantastic .
I have recently eaten at Black Bear restaurant , a typical Sicilian restaurant in Trecastagni , a little town near Catania located under the Etna volcano slopes , and I found that restaurant was easily the best I have eaten in .
There were two rooms , smoking room or non - smoking room .
The surroundings were rustic , yet it still felt airy and cosy , the waiters were very friendly and informative .
As I was eaten with my friend Moreno and his father , I managed to sample a good range of items on the menu and I really liked Chianina beef , it was very tasty .
All the ingredients were clearly fresh and of the highest quality .
The price was n't reasonable at all , because the meal came to about forty euros per person , so this restaurant it 's a little expensive .
But I would highly recommend this restaurant despite the fact that the meal was a little expensive and I will no doubt be back for other dinners .
Drugs is a topic with a lot of controversy .
They have been present in our societies since ever .
Cannabis , heroin , speed are some examples of substances that are really well - known for all of us .
Legalization of drugs is a very used argument by people who believe that this measure could solve the problem of the exclusion .
Margination has a link with the illegality of this activity .
Also this illegality is the guilty for the attraction of the drugs because the majority of people start having drugs because they are young and its prohibition is very stimulating .
The real problem comes when this entertainment become in an addiction that can destroy our lives .
I think everyone has proved some kind of illegal drug to have fun , enjoy friends or just to prove them , and I do not believe that behaviour is wrong because everyone needs to experiment and try new things .
But we have to be responsible and have very clear that it is only something exceptional and not our daily life because it is very dangerous as some people are not able to put deadlines to themselves .
Finally , legalization of drugs means that they could be taxable and we know how the taxes work in our country so I do not know if it is a good idea or not .
Hi Shrooq ,

Dear Les ,
Firstly , Spain is a great place for holidays in summer .
In that time , it is always sunny and , depending on the region , it could rain .
If you want to see some beautiful scenery , you must go to Barcelona where you will be able to see La Sagrada Familia , which was built by Antoni Gaudi , or La Alambra in Granada , which is one of the Seven Wonders of the World .
In Madrid you can go to visit some museums , like the Reina Sofía or El Prado .
On the other hand , if you want to see some wildlife , you must visit Cabarcenos National Park in Cantabria , what is like a little safari , or Doñana National Park , which in that period you can see some migration birds .
If I were you and I had a completely summer to enjoy Spain , I would stay one week in each place , and I rent a car in order to move between the cities .
I recommend you not to take warm clothes .
I hope you enjoy your summer .

Bart Simpson is my favourite fictional character on TV .
He is the eldest son of the Simpson family .
Bart is ten years old and is a typical American child .
He has yellow skin and big eyes , he is blond and has gotspiky hair .
Bart always wears a red T - shirt and blue shorts .
The most important thing for Bart is to be the most popular student in his school , for this reason he is always misbehaving .
His parents and the school principal often punish him .
Bart is energetic and clever student but he is also a bad student and he hates nerds .
Although he is rather naughty , he has actually a heart of gold because he helps his sister when she needs him .
In the Simpson family all the characters are very funny .
A lot of magazines say The Simpsons is the best cartoon series in history and I absolutely agree .
It was one dreary rainy Sunday morning .
I was n't in the mood to go out anyway .
Everything suggested that I wo n't get out of the house for quite a while .
Suddenly , there was a heavy knock on the door .
Who on Earth could that be ?
Who would have even bothered to pay me a visit during this bloody awful weather ?
My concerns were answered swiftly , for the man on my threshold yelled : " I have a letter for Mr. Samson !
" I was quite surprised , to be honest , I had n't received a letter for months .
I opened it and quickly scanned the text .
At first , I had observed the letter cautiously , but then I noticed my uncle 's name in it .
Although , I had n't met him a single time , this letter was his last will and I learned that I inherited a good deal of money .
Fifty thousand pounds , to be precise .
Exultation seized my mind instantly , but I soon began to worry : " What will I do with this amount of money ? "
Well , the task I have chosen is about the town where I have been staying for last ten years .
Actually , this town is located in the middle of hills and a river without water .
I am very much worried about the town where I am staying because everybody of this town is not bother about rubbish things they do every day .
First of all they are very dirty by nature .
they are very casual with the environment and the importance of cleanliness .
So called people of good nature are inactive and talkative and gossip of others not doing anything for the betterment of their own town .
All the household nearby the public road throws the dirty things easily and even do n't bother about the order of the municipality .
I see all these during my morning walk .
what I feel is that everyone who are staying the town should at least keep clean their own front places and sides surrounds them .
I am upset about it and whenever I get a chance I speak with my fellow people and look for their feedback but they are also the same in nature .
People are now self - centred and very narrow minded .
Though they are becoming so called educated but in real sense they are still savage .

Nowadays , public transport has become a major topic .
The idea of leaving public transportation aside is widely supported in developed countries , but this idea is rejected in developing countries , like the one I live in .
As a matter of fact , car ownership have increased over the last decades reducing the amount of people using public transport .
The possibility of travelling in their own cars is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or even worse , the idea of wasting time in a long queue .
Nevertheless , you have another side to this reality .
There are people who can not afford to have their own cars or maybe they can afford to travel by any other means of transportation than the ones provided by the local government .
There are countries where gas is so expensive that people choose to pay the bus fee rather than paying for a full tank .
Similarly , people in countries with less income turn to these services because it is a way to reduce their overall expenses .
To conclude , the future of public transport will depend on the usage people give it .
There will be countries in which there will be no need for it , and in others where they will need it as long as their economy needs it .
People need easy , fast and cheap solutions .
In general , using a car is easier then taking a train or a bus .
It 's just near your house or your office .
You do n't have to go to a station by walking , carrying weights , or suffering because of the rain or the snow .
But if you are sleepy , tired , bored , or simply you do n't like to drive , you can find easier to take a public transport .
And also more enjoyable : you can relax listening to the music and looking around , or reading newspapers and books .
Is the car faster then public transport ?
It depends .
The traffic can affect cars and buses at the same level .
Sometimes cars are faster then buses , sometimes buses are faster .
Speed trains are always faster then cars .
Speaking about money ? Travelling by car seems cheaper than public transport .
But , if we consider all the expenses ( buying the car , paying the insurance , etc . ) , maybe cars are not so cheap .
In fact , in every aspect there are pros and cons .
What about the environment and the quality of life in the cities ?
Public transport is absolutely better .
So , even if travelling by car can be more convenient at a personal level , public transport has to be preferred by good citizens and strongly supported by governments .
Informal letter for CAE ( PART 1 )
Dear Jan ,
Thank you for your letter .
I am delighted to hear you are thinking about working in the summer .
From my experience working at the International company that organises music festivals , I can assure you that it will be of great use to you .
I am not sure , however that this job will meet all your requirements . .
In my case , the only opportunity I got for such activity was on the 22nd of July , when they allowed for a relaxing day at the festival .
Happily you will get the chance to practise your English skills .
In my case , I had to translate a good amount of texts , and also help English tourists to get around .
Though if you are looking for additional work experience you will probably be disappointed .
All I was asked to do in the rest of the time was to take phone calls and make coffee for tourists .
All in all , the experience was beneficial .
I made plenty of money , so I would n't worry about having enough for a nice holiday if I were you .
When you decide what to do , do not hesitate to let me know !
Take care of yourself ,
Favius
The past few weeks have been really tough for Michael .
This whole business started to get on his nerves .
He has to deal with it , the sooner the better .
For now one thing is clear as day - the one he is in love with is Malika , not Angelina .
The one he dates is Angelina , not Malika , that 's the problem .
He ca n't dump Angy just like that , they 've been friends for years .
She 's not bad .
And he has to put stop to this without hurting anybody .
So yes , the decision is made .
He 'll break up with her .
Probably , even tomorrow .
It all started in such an idiotic way .
The door of his room was opened , he came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist and Angelina happened to pop in to borrow a lighter or matches or something to light up a cigarette .
Mike ca n't really say why they ended up having sex - perhaps , at the time he was pissed at himself for not having balls to get the girl he loved because of all these religious issues , Malika 's family and so on , but this is what happened .
And that definitely was not the right thing to do .
At the moment he did n't realise that .
Only after , when Angelina left , Michael closed the door and there he knew he had made a huge mistake .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to apply for the post of a summer camp councellor currently advertised on your website .
At the moment I have passed the second year of secondary school and I am waiting for the beginning of my final year .
I hope I will get valuable experience by doing this job , which will be very useful in the future .
I speak English , German and Polish and as a councelor it is very handy .
I am very used to dealing with young people as last year I worked at a scout camp .
Moreover , I used to work as a volunteer when still in primary school - once a week I would go to a local club to help children with their homework .
I am hardworking , reliable and well - organised and I can take control of difficult situations . I am talented when it comes to entertaining people , which might come in very useful in my role as a summer camp councellor .
I am also an accomplished sportswoman - I am a strong swimmer and a qualified lifeguard .
I attach a reference from Tomasz Jaworska , who was my boss at the scout camp .
I would appreciate an opportunity to discuss my suitability for this post in an interview .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
XYZ
Well , I would like to talk about my school life .
I 'm seventeen years old and I 'm an electonics ' student from Italy , in the north .
I wish to be a great engineer one day so I 've decided to continue my studies at university .
I 'm good at school , my marks could prove it ; I have worked hard since the beginning of the school year .
These days I started studyng English in particular because it is the most important language in the world , so I need to know it well if I want to communicate with other people from other countries .
School is my life : I study about seven hours a day , especially maths and electronics that are the subjects that I like more .
My teachers are very good at their job so I hope to be like them one day .
The big problem in my class are the majority of my classmates : they are hopeful at school and they waste time doing nothing at school and I think even at home .
The thing that more annoys me is that they copy all the time from me and the other good students .
However , I do n't hate them at all ; they are very funny and kind people when they want .
Coming back to my dream , I would like to carry on with my studies in London , at the Imperial college .
I hope to be at a good English level because next year I am going to take the intermediate certificate of English and then I am going to try enter at this school even if I know that it 's very difficult ; the Imperial college of London is one of the most important universities in the whole world .
Puerquitour : A great experience to your mouth .
Nowadays it is difficult to find people who enjoy the food as much as I do , because the calories , the kilos they are going to gain and all that stuff .
I arrived at Mexico City one month ago and I met an old friend from high school , Vicente .
We discovered our fascination with food and ' The Puerquitour ' was born .
Then a brainstorm about meals and places to visit began .
The first day started in an important date … Taco Day !
Tacontento was the place we choose and we really enjoyed alambre al pastor and grilled onions , accompanied by cold beers .
Due to Puerquitour is something to share , the second day we shared it with Diana , one of my friends from Vancouver .
Again we ate tacos , but this time they were special .
The name of the place is Tacos La Chule and tacos are gourmet there .
It means that they have different taste of tortillas -vanilla , strawberry , chipotle , nopal , and walnut , among others- and salsas -tamarind , guava , mango , guacamole , etc .
That day did not finish with the tacos , after a walk in Reforma and a long pause in The Independence Angel we went to movie theatre to watch the art movie Renoir while we ate crepes .
Third day was one of my favourite , the place is soooooo nice and the decoration and even the attire of the waitresses makes you feel into the 50s .
La Papa Guapa , which is located in La Condesa , offers baked potatoes with name of famous women and lovely drinks .
Totally recommended !
Mar Azul Resturant , in the north of Mexico City , was the allocation for the fourth day of Puerquitour .
Seafood is delicious there , my recommendations are breaded shrimp , fish fillet and shrimp Al Pastor and coconut water .
Fifth day , it was time to eat more tacos , the place ? … El asadero Hidalguense .
You have to be starving to eat a molcajete by yourself , it is just too much for one person , so if you did not take breakfast it is a good option or you can share it with an amazing company as I did .
Do n't forget to ask for a litter of beer .
Almost a week in the Puerquitour .
The sixth day was to celebrate Magda 's final test , a friend from high school , who already presented it to get the Master Degree ; and the farewell of Vicente , who is already at the USA , and that I will go to the UK .
Because we like the food , we celebrated eating in Memelas Pub .
You ca n't go there and do n't eat memelas , that is like huarache but bigger and very delicious .
The dessert ?
Ice cream in Tepoznieves .
Seventh day started with a really nice breakfast , gourmet sandwiches and rose petal tea .
Then we went to a book fair and visited some bookstores downtown .
The plan was to dinner at Hilaria Gastrobar for all the good comments about it , but that day it was closed ; so we decided to eat at El Huequito the traditional Al Pastor Special accompanied by black beer .
The last day of The Puerquitour was accomplished with my favourite dessert , a strawberry cheesecake at Starbucks and a long talk about nothing and everything .
I love to spend time doing what I like and with people I love .
Do n't forget to practise and enjoy Puerquitour ! ! !
These first two chapters extracted from Great Expectations by Charles Dickens introduce a young boy known as Pip .
This kid has been raised by his sister , a person who mistreats Pip and his own husband .
Sadly , Pip has no fortune in any possible way .
Moreover , he is just a regular kid with a terrible life .
Beside this , Pip seems to be a shy and intelligent kid .
He does not use complex words when he talks , but he uses them when he narrates .
Also , his life would be perfect to create a dark comedy based on the undesirable life of a kid who only feels comfortable when he visits the tombstones of his parents .
Obviously , nobody would like to live his life , but I think everyone would tend to feel sadness reading these chapters and , finally , like him .
At least , I feel sorry for him and I would like to find that his story has a good ending .
He looks like a good boy that lives in hell and the Devil is his sister .
Nevertheless , the narrator is the truly protagonist and the way to tell the actions is the reason why the story can connect with the reader .
Actually , the narrator is our protagonist , but telling the story as an adult .
And the author does not try to describe the protagonist with words , but with actions .
The narrator did not use any description of the protagonist apart from his name .
Also , the narrator mainly uses direct speech , but he only uses indirect speech in just a few occasions referring to his own words .
This exception can be read at the end of the first chapter , where the narrator answer the thief writing that he said that he would get him the file , and that he would get him what broken bits of food he could , and he would come to the thief at the Battery .
Apart from this , he just writes exactly what the characters said .
The voice is in first person and uses a subjective point of view .
He only knows what he sees and he thinks about it , but he does not have any omniscient power .
However , his power could be analyzing and describing the situations with a rich vocabulary and in a reflexive way too .
Also , he describes his parents in a hilarious way , imaging his father as a square , stout , dark man , with curly black hair just looking at their tombstone .
These twisted and creative thoughts are spread all over the text , accompanied by even more twisted reflections like at the end of the first chapters , when he describes the man who stole him as man afraid of the dead bodies in the graveyard just because he saw him hugging himself .
Beside this , the characters of the novel seem to be unhappy , living a sad and boring life that pushes them to abuse our protagonist , with the exception of Joe .
The narrator does not make an effort to describe psychologically the other characters , he focuses on their appearance .
Actually , we only know that Mrs. Joe tries to make her husband and hers brother suffer and she is worries more about what their neighbors think about her rather than worrying about the person who live in his own house .
The narrator describes her as woman that has earned a good reputation being aggressive with his little brother .
And we know that Joe is a good man because the protagonist describes him as a mild , good - natured , sweet - tempered , easy - going and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
Also , the way the characters talk is opposed to the way the narrator writes .
In fact , the dialogues of each character are not longer than more than two sentences , with the only exception of the thief that talks about his partner in twelve long sentences with complex structures .
This kind of structure is widely used by the narrator , but the characters usually talk with short and simple sentences .
For instance , here is an extract of the narrator at the beginning of the second chapter :
" My sister , Mrs. Joe Gargery , was more than twenty years older than I , and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up " by hand . "
Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant , and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me , I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand . "
On the other hand , the dialogues are simple and shorter :
" Now lookee here , " he said , " the question being whether you 're to be let to live . You know
what a file is ? "
" Yes , sir . "
" And you know what wittles is ? "
" Yes , sir . "
Moreover , the vocabulary used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters said .
Pip uses a rich vocabulary , using a lot of mental verbs and abstract concepts that are usually inspired by concrete things .
The marsh pointed on the first chapter is good example .
Regardless , the dialogues are written exactly as they were said .
The thief said " Who d'ye with ? "
This is written as it is said , making it more realistic .
Notwithstanding , the way this novel is narrated is the protagonist .
The events are narrated in a mysterious way , telling us what happened in a realistic story - line without flashback .
The story is narrated as it happens .
The second chapter makes reference to the first and reveals something about the thief .
Also , the slow rhythm is adequate .
The narrator reveals not so much about him or the other characters , but he writes about the essential things we should know through the text .
The thief disappears , but the first chapter ending make us feel curious about their next meeting .
Therefore , I do not know how the story will end .
Too much mystery and just a few facts can be read in these chapters .
All I know is that this story will not have a happy ending .
Probably , the thief will take Pip to an unwanted adventure that will make him growing up faster .
I would like to read a story where Pip ends as he starts , at the graveyard .
Like another brick in the wall , another tombstone in the graveyard .
I would like to read a story without tale , just a regular man who died while he was learning to live .
Obviously , this would be difficult as the narrator voice clearly comes from a person who lives while he is writing .
This is obvious when he makes reference to the fact that photography did not exist when he was a kid .
Consequently , reading these chapters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to tell what is going to happen or , what is more , what the author is trying to transmit .
If the story has a happy ending , then the central theme could be getting over adversities ; if not , it is a sad story .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
She has been waiting so long for this day to come .
It was the day when she was going to meet her biological mother .
She knew she was adopted since she was 7 years old because her parents told her about it .
She did not feel bad about it because she loves her parents very much and she feels loved by them .
After her 18th birthday , Anna felt a sudden necessity of knowing what happened to her bilogical mother and why did she gave Anna away .
After finding the adoption papers she contacted the adotpion agency .
She convinced the lady at the agency to give her the name of the biological mother of " her little sister who had a disease and needed to know if her bilogical mother would be a match for a kidney transplant " .
Even though it was illegal , the lady gave her the name and the contact phone number of Sara Fielding , her biological mother .
A month passed by before she had the courage to dial that number .
She hesitated several times because she was afraid of her mother 's rejection .
After a few seconds , a woman picked up the phone .
At the beginning Anna did not say anything , she could not utter any sound .
But then she said " hello , my name is Anna and I think you are my mother " .
After another few seconds of silence , Anna heard her mother crying and asking lots of questions .
They agreed to meet the next day in the park .
She was going to have so many answers to so many questions .
Anna will be able to finally close an important chapter in her life and that is why she knew that it was going to be a very special day .
The most exciting day of my life .
Last summer I went on holiday in Sardegna , in Italy , with my family .
On the first day I was very angry because my parents did n't take with us Ilaria , my best friend .
But I changed my mind when I heard at the radio that Felix Sandman , a Swedish singer , was on Holiday in Sardegna near my hotel !
I love him and my dream was to meet him , but I knew it was impossible and my parents did n't want to drive me to his hotel , so I was quite sad .
Unexpectedly , the third day , while I was swimming in the sea , I saw some people in the distance and some cameras , but at the moment I thought they were making a video .
Then , I realised the boy at the centre was n't a simple boy , He was Felix !
So I went toward the crowd and when he saw me he smiled .
I was really exciting !
Then I went to him and he took a photo with me .
He stayed there a few hours and I spent the best day of my life , asking him some questions and singing his songs .
When he left I was sad but also really happy .
This was certainly the most exciting day of my life .
L'Albero , the Best Pizza West of Italy
One of my favourite restaurants that I am always hungry for is L'Albero Pizzeria , located in the Huelin neighbourhood .
As you enter the restaurant you know the pizza is going to be good .
The walls are covered with trophies and photographs for the worlds best pizza .
The space is family friendly , a perfect place to celebrate a birthday or meet friends .
My only complaint is there are too many delicious choices on the menu , it is often difficult deciding what to order .
So far I have never been disappointed .
To start , you must try the Rose Wind Salad , it 's a fresh , flavourful salad that is served in a bowl made of pizza crust .
As a main dish , you ca n't go wrong ordering one of their pizza 's , all are made fresh to order in their authentic Italian pizza oven .
Besides the great atmosphere and the delicious eat , the service is friendly and efficient .
The staff is very helpful explaining the menu to customers .
Also the prices are incredibly cheap , it 's around 12 euros per person for two different dishes , drinks and desert .
I completely recommend this terrific restaurant to anyone who is passionate about great food for an even better value .
I promise you wo n't be disappointed .
The best places for young people in Dublin
This report looks at the best places to visit in Dublin for young people from a different country .
It is based on a survey of the young people from Whitehall College as well as my own opinion as a permanent resident in the area .
It seems that the majority of those surveyed are of the opinion that the best place to visit for young people would be Temple Bar .
It offers a wide variety of activities like museums , a cinema , a very large green garden and many pubs to choose from .
The Johnnie Fox Pub was highly recommended , it offers an opportunity to listen to traditional music , watch dancers perform and enjoy a nice meal in one place .
The Odeon cinema offers a multiple choice of movies in 2D and 3D and a discount for students on Wednesdays .
The Dublin Wax Museum was suggested by many students .
Several people said that National Botanic Garden is the best place for students to meet and spend time outdoors .
On the whole there are activities to take part in and many places to visit depending on students preferences and finances available to them .
It is true that people everywhere like watching sports .
Sports starts being admired by youth and can imprint a model of behavior on the young 's minds .
In this essay both sides of the position stated above will be analyzed before my own perspective is provided .
From one point of view , top athletes are good models to emulate for several reasons .
Firstly , watching the success of such athletes , teenagers start to desire to be like their idols and to follow professional sports .
This means they will want to play sports , which is essential for their health .
Secondly , doing sports also teaches priceless life lessons , such as discipline and dealing with success and failure .
The importance of working hard to achieve goalы and practicing regularly to become good at something are also demonstrated by professional sportsmen .
This is a good example for youngsters to follow .
From another perspective , sometimes professional athletes are not good role models .
Firstly , sport has become business .
Many sports stars are only concerned about money and fame .
This can lead adolescents to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play well and having the fun of the game or the competition .
Secondly , there are those athletes who behave disgustingly .
For example , some take drugs or cheat in order to win at any cost .
It goes without saying , that this kind of behavior sends a wrong message to the young .
In conclusion , there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in regard to professional sportsmen as good role models for young people .
On balance , I am inclined to believe that professional athletes can be excellent role models for the youth , as long as they represent the positive aspects of playing sports .
Dickens and the Bronte sisters use the same style : realistic style .
They are influenced by the surrounding in which they live : Dickens the city of London while the Bronte sisters the natural landscape of the Yorkshire .
Dickens and Charlotte Bronte often use the first person narrator or the point of view of the protagonist of the story .
Their realism is different : in fact Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism in which he mixes pathos and comedy , like characters that tend to be caricatures of the vices and virtues he wish to portray , while the Bronte sisters use realistic style laced with Romantic and Gothic elements , like Byronic male heroes and female protagonists that are psychologically complex .
The graph illustrates the four different sources of consumption of fish and other meat in European country from 1979 to 2004 .
Of the given source , the overall fish and meat consumption ranked from nearly 60 grams per person per week to roughly 230 grams per person per week .
From the 4 source ate , 3 of them remained a steady decline with the exception of chicken consumption which had risen over the 25 year period .
Only fish consumption showed little change during the period , beginning and ending at approximately the same the level of 52 grams per person per week .
Both lamb consumption and the category labelled beef had a decline trend between 1979 and 2004 , although maintained a decrease overall , with lamb consumption falling from a peak of 150 grams per person per week in 1979 down to just over 50 grams per person per week in 2004 and beef consumption falling from around 230 grams per person per week down to just over 120 grams per person per week .
Chicken consumption was the only source of meat consumption which elaborated stable climbing from 150 grams per person per week to the highest consumption 250 per person per week .
Overall , it is evident from the graph that some sectors declined , others rose and one remained steady consumption over the 25 year span .
Dear Mr. Merrifield :
My name is Dmitry Lavrov .
I 'm a postdoc in Russian Cancer Research Center .
Our lab works along with Alexis Hervieux on his study of arpin .
Recently he has visited Moscow and while we 've been having conversation I 've mentioned that I was looking for the opportunity to work on postdoc position abroad .
And since my great interest is to develop my skills in microscopy and digital image analysis while working in the field of cell biology Alexis told me to try and contact you .
Our conversation with Alexis and your own publications - all supports the suggestion that working in your lab apparently will provide valuable opportunities to master methodological and research skills .
Not to mention the participation in pioneering study .
My own work is dedicated to the study of changes in cell - cell contacts and in actin cytoskeleton that take place during neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells .
Earlier I had a publication in PLoS One with description of dissimilarities in organization and regulation of adherence junctions associated with different types of actin bundles in normal and transformed epithelial cells .
Thereafter I studied accumulation of various actin - binding proteins and actin isoforms within adherence junction in normal and transformed cells .
On the coarse of this investigation I have obtained some promising results which I 'm going to report on the FEBS - EMBO conference which will take place in Paris in the beginning of september .
Also I 'm preparing materials for the next publication .
Yours respectfully ,
Dmitry Lavrov
P.S. There are my CV and a copy of my paper in the attachment .

I am writing about an important historical place which is my favourite one , I am referring to Lugo city .
I visited Lugo last summer and I enjoyed myself very much .
I walked through the old city , through its beautiful squares and parks and I visited its numerous churches , including the cathedral .
There are a lot of places in Lugo worth visiting .
For example , you can walk around the Roman Wall , which has been declared a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000 because it is the only Roman Wall in the world that is complete .
I think that Lugo is very beautiful .
There are a lot of shops where tourists and visitors can buy souvenirs and there are many restaurants where you can eat delicious and typical dishes , for example , octopus .
In Lugo , many traditional parties and festivals take place .
Among the most important I can mention San Froilán and Arde Lucus .
From 4th to 12th October Lugo holds its San Froilán Fiestas .
San Froilán is a festival of National Tourist Interest .
This festival is dedicated to the city 's patron saint , and it shows traditional Galician costumes and folklore .
Another important festival in Lugo is Arde Lucus .
It is celebrated in June .
During this festivity , Lugo becomes the 3rd century town once again , so you can see Roman circus , Celtic weddings , artisan markets , many musical events taking place and local people and visitors get into period costumes , such as gladiators and Roman Emperors .
I recommend you visit Lugo in June because Arde Lucus is celebrated .
You can enjoy traditional Roman customs and Roman life in Arde Lucus .
Lugo is and incredible city and it is important in the history of my country because it is full of historical places , festivities which show and perform precise periods of the history of Spain , such as the Celtic period and the Roman period .
The bigger the city , bigger the problem .
The town is the 2nd largest urban agglomeration in the country , producing daily large amounts of waste . "
City X " has no specific waste disposal plan , but a federal law establishes a due term until 1st July .
Despite it , there are a few plans to increase the green areas and revitalize the town .
The city is thriving on implementing new measures to achieve the Council 's goals .
The analysis will consist of evaluating the Council 's eco - friendly proposals .
In accord with the aforementioned , the amount of garbage produced during the years 2007 and 2010 more than doubled , 86% of it discarded inadequately .
This is due to the low effect of the " Recycling Worms " program over the disposal problem . "
City X " incinerates hospital residue , in accordance with legal requirements , and send 7% of the garbage production to recycling factories .
The recycling factories have a joint venture with the municipality to sort waste , and show a result 20% better than last year .
The program represents 2% of the employment in the city , but it needs to expand .
The city has many projects such as the " Keep it clean , keep it beauty " , whose goal is to promote proper disposal in the public areas .
Another important one is the " Let 's make it green " , responsible for increasing the green areas within the city in 150% during the last two years , consisting of a combination of public and private investment in reforestation of rural and communal areas .
A later crucial activity are the " Green Communities " , currently carrying 38% of the total amount of consumed vegetables in the metropolitan area .
A municipal waste policy that integrates private and public sectors and the community is required to solve the current problem .
The increase of green areas represent a significant improvement in the quality of life according to the USED report of 2012 and also fits in 16 of 20 requirements of a city of the future .
Most of the " Recycling Worms " problem is caused by this lack of training , which can be resolved by training offered in the surrounding universities .
It is a good idea to take a year off between leaving school and starting university , because you can have lots of new experiences .
For example , you can travel to new places .
Another idea is you can work , you can find a job and earn money before you start university .
Moreover , sometimes people are tired when they finish school because of the exams so they need to have some time to relax .
You can travel to different countries if you have time , I would like to go to Asia , Thailand or China .
But you need to earn money if you want to travel , so you can first work and then travel .
You can find work as a waiter or in a shop .
However , some people think you should go to university immediately after you finish school because if you do n't , you forget what you have learned in school .
But I think you can also learn if you travel or if you work so that is a good idea also , especially if you find a job related with what you want to study .
We live in a time when everything changes quickly .
A technological development make people believe that in the future everything will look like in science - fiction movies .
We 'll be surrounded by machines and robots .
We 'll have a possibility to choose on which planet we want to live .
And what about houses ?
Will people 's homes be different or still the same ?
Imagining the future , I see everything different .
The avant - garde and futuristic projects of houses will be the most desirable .
The houses will have , for example , the shape of a sphere or igloo .
Some of them might be turned upside down .
Sometimes they will be some kind of a modern art and it will be hard to describe a shape .
And what about interiors ?
In our service there will be more machines and robots with an artificial intelligence .
They will practically do everything : clean , cook , remind us what we have to do and also speak with us like an average human .
In practice there will be no normal furniture , just machines waiting for a command .
Everything will be artificial and uncozy .
That 's how I see a home of the future .
Glad to hear that you 've been invited to attend the last round of interview next month !
I really hope to work with you someday !
To make sure you get the position successfully , here are some useful advice and information you might want to know .
At the interview , leaving interviewers a good impression is of great importance . Here're some tips on how to do it .
First , dressing as properly as possible .
Businesslike suits and ties fit in well with the formal occasion .
Suitable dressing comes across as effective and reliable .
Second , being punctual .
Interviewers have to cope with tight schedule everyday so they are n't willing to spare one more minute to wait for a candidate who 's late somehow .
Third , being prepared .
As the old saying goes , well prepared is half done .
You 're expected to know something about our company , ask proper questions and communicate effectively with interviewers .
If you can learn as much knowledge about our company as you can up front , you really stand a chance in the interview .
Since you 've applied for the sales assistant in the sales department , the sales manager will be interviewing you .
He started out his career as an accountant , but he was fed up with dealing with numbers all day long .
Plus , he 's willing to communicate with others and take on new challenges so he transferred to the sales department two years ago .
He got promoted very quickly because he always brought forth new ideas and facilitated the reform and development in the department .
In his eyes , what counts most is the track record and the capabilities shown in the previous working experiences , so he might ask you some questions like what you achieved and how you felt about your last job .
I hope what I mention above will be of some help to you .
Looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Lots of Love ,
Iris
Dear Sir or Madam
I write in connection with your advertisement regarding jobs at summer camps all over the USA .
Since my mother tongue is English , albeit of the British variety , and I am generally deemed cheerful , energetic and hard working , I believe I am a suitable candidate for the aforementioned position .
Additionally , as a teenager , I supervised a Wolf Cub pack of eight to twelve - year - olds , and often organised sports and evening activities for them , such as treasure hunts and paper chases .
Moreover , when an undergraduate , I spent my summers working in the college canteen as a kitchen help , and progressed to the position of cook .
Because of all the above points , I think I am a suitable person for the job .
Yours faithfully
I find it quite difficult to find an area of improvement given Andres 's outstanding overall performance .
Yet , oftentimes , being overly respectful may play against him and although he has gained the respect of all the people he has worked with , some of them suggested he should build up his self - confidence , rather than end up attempting to cover everyone 's back and taking ownership for other people 's mistakes .
If I had my own language school I would first bear in mind a main goal : raising public awareness of my language school and the services it will provide .
Then I would start gathering some information about the market , that is to say , social trends , population statistics such as age , gender and family type , potential customers and competitors as well .
By doing so , I would be able not only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my product and to improve my performance but also to identify customers ' needs .
After that , I would make a list of target markets and device some strategies to attract them .
For instance , if my goal was to increase young people 's awareness , some strategies could be to increase online social media presence by posting regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Facebook or to offer discounts for sibblings .
Instead , if my goal was to increase adult 's awarenes , advertising in local newspapers or offering intensive courses could prove successful .
However , if the target markets were both , young people and adults , offering discounts for family groups could be a better choice .
The last step would be to recruit a staff of prfesional , experienced and qualified teachers and to set an attractive and reasonable price for the services I would provide .
Last but not least , I would test ideas and approaches on customers and staff to make sure that my marketing plan succeeded .
And you ?
Have you ever thought about how you can promote your language courses for example ?
I challenge you to think about it and try it .
According to recent research , there are no doubts that natural gas drilling rigs , natural gas pipelines and underground gas storage contribute to increasing wealth of the local communities .
People who live in the areas of natural gas infrastructure earn from a few to several percent more than those who live in other regions where such an infrastructure does n't exist .
Another advantage is that developing natural gas industry equals new jobs what is profitable for people living in whereabouts .
Exploration and extraction of the shale gas will create lots of new jobs in very different branches connected with gas industry for instance in exploration , mining , production and distribution of shale gas .
We can not ignore the fact that companies which cooperate with this infrastructure will also create vacancy jobs .
Even if companies will hire engineers and specialists mostly from abroad , there will be upgrowth in a number of job positions in gastronomy and hospitality zones as they need to eat and sleep somewhere .
According to the dynamics of development of the natural gas infrastructure , there will be constant development in gastronomy and hospitality sectors as well .
The Kosciuszko Institute conducted a research which shows that Poland can benefit from extracting and developing the infrastructure of shale gas
Greece is an amazing country that a lot of people visit annually .
When planning their vacation a lot of tourists are faced with the dilemma of which places to visit .
Choosing where to go in Greece can be hard as there are so many choices .
There are some travel destinations that definitely stand out , such as Santorini .
Sandy beaches , crystal clear waters and the friendly locals are not the only things that set it apart from other islands .
Santorini also has a volcano which is a spectacular sight , even though exploring it can be dangerous !
Another place worth visiting in Greece is Athens .
Believe it or not , Athens is one of the most beautiful cities in the world .
The Parthenon , the Acropolis Museum and the district of Monastiraki are just a few of the things that people love about Athens .
Last but not least , Crete is one of the most spectacular islands in Greece .
Other than having beautiful sandy beaches and being the largest island in Greece , people can visit the water sports parks there , which are extremely fun !
Summing up , Greece is a beautiful country worth visiting , although choosing where to go can be hard .
The question is whether it 's better to prepare for a long time before the exam or few days are going to be enough .
In my personal experience , I believe that it 's much better to prepare for a long time before any exam you may face in your life .
It 's quite important to be organized to get the highest score you can get in your exam .
For example , one year ago , I had my final surgery exam .
I had set up a plan to study all the books we had to go through for the exam plus reviewing them twice .
The plan required my commitment for around a 12 hours daily study for almost 3 months .
For the hard work and perfect discipline , I was able to get a very high score in my Surgery finals .
If I had n't had such an organized plan , I would never have got such a perfect score .
Another thing to add is not being stressed before the exam night .
It 's quite normal to have this basic feeling of being stressed and nervous when exams are approaching .
What is not normal at all is having anxiety due to the plethora of studies you haven't finished and are included in your exam .
For example , I once had a chemistry exam in high school and I was ignorant enough to neglect my studies thinking that I still had enough time to ace my exam .
Two days before my exam , I realized that I ran out of time .
I had insomnia the night of my exam , it was n't enough that I was n't well prepared but also my nerves got torn out and that affected my scores tremendously .
Ever since I do everything in its due time in order not to be overly stressed and get low scores .
Moreover , if I aim at getting high scores , I assert that memorizing the details is important .
If you do n't start studying before exam with an appropriate time , you will only have enough time to know the broad lines of the subject , but this will never help you soak the details and understand the concepts lying behind every single word .
That will help you a lot even if you do n't get the chance to revise everything before your exam .
I can recall that time when I was quite ill before my Anatomy exam ; I could only go through the main titles of each branch without going through the details .
In the exam , I had that question where it required describing a concept ; amazingly , I was able to do it perfectly .
Since I had practiced a lot and memorized that concept before many times , I was able to remember it .
It was just flooding without so much effort .
So , for sure having enough time to memorize and practice what you learn is going to help you a lot in your exam .
In sum , I believe that setting a schedule to have a long time preparation plan is much better than having only few days to get prepared . If you want to get high scores and perform greatly , you should start studying from day one if possible .
Do n't you think you are worth getting the highest score one could aim at ?
In my opinion , nuclear energy has the best chance to replace fossil fuels .
Firstly , nuclear energy is n't bad for the environment .
The Carbon dioxide emissions is very small .
The biggest threat is the explosion .
However , the technology is evolving and nuclear power plants are getting safer .
Secondly , nuclear power plants are already very popular and this type of energy is the closest to replace fossil fuels .
Energy which we get from sun and wind is still are only a few percent of world energy production .
Thirdly , only the construction of a nuclear power plant is expensive .
When we have a plant , making energy from that is very cheap .
The most expensive thing in nuclear plant is to hire qualified personnel .
Besides , we need something that can work all the time .
It ca n't stop making energy when the weather is bad , because people need a lot of electricity .
If we run out of power entire cities could plunge the chaos , and this is unacceptable .
Lima is the only South American city which is a capital and it is located overlooking the Pacific Ocean .

Hi Jane ,
Last time you asked me for some information about opening a saving account in the UK . I 've done some research to find out the best savings account for you .
Below you can find a few suggestions of mine .
The Phone Bank might give quite a good offer for you .
Firstly , the rate of interest is by 3.1% , which is quite good .
Additionally , if you open a saving account in that bank , you will get a diary as a gift .
And you do not need to pay any annual charges for having a credit card .
Unfortunately , the bank does n't have branches in Britain .
And all banking operations must be done by phone .
The second bank , Royal Savings Bank , has many branches in the UK ( over 650 ) , so you can make all bank operations on spot .
But there is a service charge for owning a credit card ( £ 12 per year ) .
You do also get a gift as a new account holder , a full set of saucepans ( do you really need it ? ) .
All in all , I would recommend you to open your first serving account in the Phone Bank , since the rate of interest is higher and you do n't need to pay any annual charges .
And doing operations by phone are actually very easy and they always give you a great opportunity to improve your English .
The final decision is yours .
Take care and see you very soon ,
Yours Agnieszka

Subject : An important thing to do !
My dear Paul ,
I 'm writing to tell you how happy I am that I had the opportunity to be the chosen person to deal with the sound recording at Lady Gaga 's concert .
It must have been my friend , Marius Boni , who recommended me for this service .
I could n't believe my ears when the phone rang and I answered and they said they wanted me to get at the concert as soon as possible to see how good I was in sound recording .
What can I say ?
It 's been my dream since childhood and now I was overwhelmed when I realised they thought at me to do this for such a great , important person in the world music industry .
I am glad that they were satisfied with my service .
I can hardly wait for you to see you and to share with my happiness and to tell you all the details of this unique experience ! ! !
Yours ,
Ionut
I have been skiing for most of life and I am very enthusiastic about it .
I started when I was six with equipment that was very basic compared to what skiers use these days .
Every day as soon as I woke up I looked forward to my morning on the slopes .
My parents would take me to a gentle slope with my brother and leave us there for a couple of hours to try skiing on our own .
The temperature was often several degrees below zero , and you would freeze if you did n't keep moving up and down the slope .
My brother showed a natural talent for the sport , but I felt quite uncomfortable and scared .
Little by little I improved my skiing skills and by the time I was a teenager I really started enjoying myself .
Nowadays I have a lot of fun skiing because it gives me the opportunity to be in a wonderful natural environment .
Skiing is a great sport , but I would recommend starting as a child , taking a few lessons with an experienced instructor and using the right equipment .
After six years of rigorous high school subjects and past experiences , I have no doubt that the preferences I 've selected above are not accidental .
I am extremely interested in gaining experience in the business field .
The subjects I 've pursued at my high school level such as financial accounting , commerce and economics has given me the opportunity to utilize and put into perspective the knowledge of understanding business concepts and has given me a solid academic foundation .
I 've also participated in various group works and class projects while in high school .
I am planning to gain admission into the university of my choice in order to obtain a bachelor 's degree .
I would love to associate with extremely talented students , lecturers and even professors in order to receive a well rounded introduction to the numerous aspects of any of the preferences I 've selected above .
Academically , I 've always been a very determined and studious individual and I would be more than willing to devote myself to the hardwork necessary in order to achieve a bachelor 's degree .
I also have an indubitable passion for extra - curricular activities .
I was the president of the Business Students Association ( BSA ) , Head Boy ( senior prefect boy ) and Captain of the soccer school team .
I am a very good soccer player who plays a midfield role .
Undertaking a scholarship and admission into one of the universities I have selected above will provide me with the opprtunity to apply the knowledge gained at high school into a business setting , as well as develop the communication , organisation and numeracy skills I have acquired at high school .
After I heard about the Czech Government Scholarship , I decided to make some research on Czech Republic before taking any step in applying .
I found out that Czech Republic is a country with rich possibilities for students planning to study abroad and is currently undergoing rapid social changes and transformation , making it a fascinating place for students of any discipline to study in .
Czech universities provides high standards of education , internationally recognized degrees , modern campuses with outstanding facilities , safe and affordable education warm and friendly environment and cultural diversity .
I believe that I will have the opportunity to experience both modernity and tradition in one if the safest and most stable countries in Europe .
Above all , the high quality if education will make me ready for the future .
Another major reason why I am being motivated to study in Czech Republic is lack of finance .
Also , education in Nigeria is now a joke as teachers and lecturers go on strike frequently , and learning in some parts of Nigeria are not safe !
Right now , I am greatly looking forward to the challenges of a university life academically , socially and mentally , and I believe that my ambition to learn new business concepts coupled with my passion for extra - curricular activities and community service , would make me a competent addition to the any of my proposed university and the Czech Republic Scholarship team .
I believe that I can make a positive contribution to my proposed university , as I will be actively involved in student events and activities that will help to promote a healthy learning environment for all .
In conclusion , I can assure you that I will be a capable and dedicated student who has the committment and dedication to work hard in order to be a graduate , whilst at the same time , contributing greatly to my proposed university in more ways than one .
A dog is man 's best friend
It is a well - known fact that people need to have communication with other people .
However , they are not always satisfied or taken into the society .
They seek solace in someone who they would feel more comfortable with .
The best example is an animal with great qualities , a dog .
Dog 's personality is one of their best qualities .
Always friendly , bubbly and in a good mood , they are great to spend time with .
They feel when their master is sad and react by cuddling up to them .
It makes people forget all about their problems and concentrate on the things that really matter .
Dog 's optimism is by far the best way to bring back a smile on people 's face .
And that is what they are there for , to make people happy .
These hairy four - legged animals are also very protective .
One of their jobs is to watch out their human family .
So if they sense that their owner might be in danger , they immediately react by barking at a person or a thing thing that might have caused it .
The stronger the bond between the dog and their owner , the stronger the dog 's reaction will be .
It is believed that dogs require a lot of attention , which is not true .
Dogs are really not that hard to take care of , bathing and grooming do n't need to be done every day , they just need to be fed and walked regularly .
These pets need a few walks a day , which could also be good for their owners who are spending all day at work or in school and need some physical activity .
So having a dog could also remind them to live a healthier life .
In conclusion , dogs make really great pets .
Not only do they protect you from anything that could do you any harm , but their amazing personality and the love they show to you makes you feel so warm and wonderful on the inside .
So if someone really loves their pet , they would find time to pay lot of attention to them , because , they truly are man 's best friend .
Hi John !
It 's great to hear from you again ! I will give you some details about my experience at " Zoe Kak adventure " , one of the most well - known centres in our country .
First of all , we started with a tiring assault course , which consisted of climbing up pretty sharp walls and crawling through different obstacles .
Although it made me feel exhausted , I found it extremely entertaining .
Luckily , I was fit enough to finish the exercise without having any problem , however , you may need to train a little bit more before embarking on this activity .
Rock climbing was another of the challenges I had to face .
Despite the fact that it turned out to be harder than I had expected , I managed to reach the summit .
You ca n't imagine how rewarding is the feeling of being on the top of the mountain , after such a big effort!.
Furthermore , you will be able to practise canoeing . You are likely to feel scared at first , but your confidence will be built up quickly , due to the constant support of your teachers .
One of the last activities offered by the centre was diving .
I felt so overwhelmed that I had to give it up , so if you do n't want to miss out this great opportunity too , trust your trainers , since they are highly qualified .
To sum up , I strongly believe that you will have a great time there and I guarantee you that all the teachers meet with the safety rules , so you will enjoy a lot without getting yourself into trouble .
Write soon and let me know if you need to know anything else .
With best wishes :
Sara .
I felt so excited when I looked at the envelope on the desk of my room .
I checked the address as quickly as I could and I realized that I was right , it was from Paris ...
My mother had written me after months !
Since she left to Paris last year I had been living in the school residence , which was n't cheerful at all , what made me feel really depressed .
But I had her letter at last , so I started to read it immediately .
She told me that when I was on holidays I had to buy myself a plane ticket to Paris and go to visit her for at least two months because she was missing me a lot .
It felt so good when I saw that my mother had n't forgotten me .
I had never travelled to Europe yet so I was really nervous too , but it would be a great chance to improve my French and spend a lot of time with my beloved mother in the city of love .

Education is a milestone in our life and having a good education is the main door to the labor market .
Aware parents disappointed with educational systems and institutionalized education try to spot in homeschooling a solution for their children 's education .
Although homeschooling may seem , according to some of these parents ' opinions , " a paved road " , it
is a path not suitable for everybody 's cars and that compels us to seek other routes .
Homeschooling should not be considered a wold - wide phenomenon since only a few countries : the UK ,
Canada , and especially the USA , can boast .
There are lots of countries that do not
accept homeschooling as a legal alternative so far and others where it is just an isolated happening .
The situation in Spain can be assessed as " legal vacuum " in light of our constitutional right to free
education meanwhile attendance is compulsory in elementary and secondary education .
Educational and emotional freedom support this alternative way of learning .
Homeschooling may also free up time for complementary activities such as music , sports , and even the family life .
Homeschooled students ' success has been backed up by the results on standardize test and the recognition of prestigious universities .
Now though , before homeschooling your kids you also have to consider the same amount of roadblocks :
the lack of facilities or expertise , not enough socialization for your children , ending up being a frustrated parent without enough money to make ends meet .
As far as I am concerned I want to think about homeschooling as a wake up call for educational
systems .
However , homeschooling will never succeed if parents do not have the right skills .
As traditional education seems to be exhausted , new technologies open up as " the
solution " and blended learning is the future .
Geographic and natural environment around the building space , as well as the neighbourhood , would be surely taken into consideration while designing houses of the future .
Obviously , the future also indicates a home with more technology and very energy efficient systems .
In areas exposed to cataclysms , such as earthquakes , hurricanes and floods , people should have their houses built of resistant materials .
Steel or concrete structures would give the desired effect in this particular matter .
Environmentally friendly buildings will be definitely on the drawing board .
Built with recyclable or recycled materials , the exterior surface of these houses should be ready to be lit by daylight on sunny days , not to mention skylights and solar panels on the roofs , which is more and more popular even these days .
Moreover , solar energy collectors ought to be controlled by computers in order to maximise comfort and energy efficiency .
Urban housing issues ( such as population growth ) will be solved by exploiting some new areas .
Maybe it 's building castles in the air , but houseboats and apartments situated above city streets seem to be a perfect solution to use up space that would otherwise be wasted .
Although people would keep mulling over how to modernize their fancy houses ( and bragging about it to neighbours ) , they will still need a warm , cosy bed and a nice cup of tea .
I suppose that will never change , even if they live in a concrete ivory tower .
Catch it or lose it
The alpha and the omega of a good team is trust .
That 's the most important point if you want to play handball .
You must be able to throw the ball blindly to your teammate and he has to catch it .
Otherwise the opponent will have the chance to get a point .
Are you a real team player ?
Handball is one of the most dynamic sports in this world .
Over eighty points can be made all together in sixty minutes , if not even more .
This shows how rapidly the game can change .
One lost ball can make your team the loser of the game .
I started to play handball when I was 5 years old .
At first , it was only a hobby but with the years it became passion .
What I love most about this sport is , the speed and the unconditional team spirit .
If you want to practise handball , just be sure that you have a good team and do n't forget the fun !
Triathlon : A famous sport throughout the world
It seems as if , recently , society has become more conscious of the importance of practising a sport .
Clearly , this is a consequence of the extra hours we have to work per day and as a way of relaxing , we find doing a sport as an effective way of taking the stress of our bodies .
In fact , we can see many people jogging and cycling these days whether it is in the morning before going to work or even after .
Despite these two being the most popular sports amongst atlets , many more are just as interesting and profitable .
One of them is triathlon , which is my favourite sport .
It consists of a mixture between three different sports , swimming , cycling and jogging and as a result it can be extremely demanding .
What I enjoy most about it is being able to practise it anywhere , which means I can do it near home instead of having to go to a sports center .
It also means I can choose the location that most pleases me and therefore fully enjoy the time spent doing it .
Triathlon has become more popular over the past few years and more and more people are eager to try it .
Therefore , it is crucial to understand that improving in such a demanding sport requires time and is is important to establish some goals in order to keep motivated .
You must not push yourself too far .
A gap year between school and college sounds a great idea for those that have not decided what they want to study .
However there are some questions whether it should be everyone or not .
First , I would like to put the arguments in favour of the year off .
Not everybody has the financial possibilities to pay for college , so taking a gap year to earn money to help with the bills it is time well spend .
But that it is not the only reason to take a year off .
Most of the people think that this year is to travel to other countries and spend all your time at parties , but this is not true , you can travel to develop your culture and do volunteer work , so you can become a better person .
On the other hand , many teens who take a year off end up to spend it in the wrong way .
For example , things might gone not as they had expected for multiple reasons such as not having enoff money or not getting a job .
In conclusion , people should take a year off , but only when they have all planed and know for shore that they have the possibility to do something useful with their time .

" Farmer Giles of Ham " is a fantasy story written by J.R.R. Tolkien .
Set in England in the first centuries of the Middle Ages , the story is about the adventures of Giles , a farmer of the village of Ham who becomes a hero against his wishes by defeating a giant .
When the dragon Chrysophylax comes and devastates everything , he is sent twice against him , not only managing to defeat him thanks to the magic sword Tailbiter , but also obtaining a huge treasure .
At the end of the story , Giles becomes an independent king .
I liked a lot this story firstly because I love fantasy stories , especially Tolkien 's ones : they bring me to another universe , making me forget every day 's life .
Secondly it is very original because it is a sort of parody of traditional legends : the hero is an ordinary person , knights reveal fearful and incompetent and clashes are won with words instead of weapons .
I would recommend this story to everybody because it is funny and adventurous and Tolkien 's ironic style , based also on the comical use of Latin words , makes it extremely pleasant to read .

Does traveling broaden your mind ?
In my opinion , travelling does broaden your mind .
When visit different places , you get to see different environments , cultures , people and even different languages .
Travelling helps you to develop as a person in many ways .
For example , if you learn another language different from your own one , even if it is just a few basic sentences , you can communicate with people from different regions and you improve your confidence .
Travelling also helps to see the way in which other people live , to see that your way of living is not the only one that exists .
This can help you to understand that not everyone has acces to many things you do have acces too , and to realise that perhaps you should appreciate these things , such as smartphones , computers , cars or even fresh water , which is a basic resource and we tend to take for granted that everyone can have some water to drink even though this is not true .
Besides , when we travel to different places we see there are many different cultures that differ greatly from our own culture , and we see how different from one another humans are .
For all of these reasons I think travelling really broadens your mind .
I want to build my career as a fully fledged researcher and academician .
To fulfill this dream a PhD degree would be the most essential footstep .
I am mostly also interested to pursue my PhD on Theoretical and Computational Chemistry .
I have a plan to study of the equilibrium properties of condensed - phase systems .
I would also like to carry out my PhD research in the development of transition metal complexes which can be used as drugs against several human diseases , as cosmetics materials and as photonic and optoelectronic materials in devices .
I also find Analytical Chemistry and Environmental Chemistry are the interesting fields of Chemistry because of their numerous applications .
I believe that I possess the strong motivation and intellectual capability to build a career in one of the previously mentioned fields .
After my PhD , I will return to my country and continue my teaching as well as research with students of University of Barisal .
There is no future for public transport ?
The number of cars grow up rapidly , however the public transport is still in use .
Especially in a big cities , where there are traffic jams , the public transport is becoming more and more popular again .
In some cities it 's even forbidden to drive through the city center without some special permission , so there is no other solution than use a public transport .
But what is more convenient - own car or public transport ?
Well it depends .... When you travel with your own car you are independent .
You do not have to worry about the schedule - you are a driver so it 's your decision whenever you want to go or stay longer in some place .
You can listen to your favorite music or radio .
You are the boss .
However , as a driver you always have to be careful and watch out on the route .
If you want to travel from one place to another to see different places , your own car is the best solution .
It allows you to see much more in your pace .
But think about the costs .
Think how much you pay for a petrol nowadays .
Consider as well how many days do you have for vacations .
Maybe cheap airlines are better ?
Being back to our everyday life .
Most of us are living in a big cities and face problems with the traffic .
What if we use the public transport to get to work ?
Well , then you do n't have to worry about the parking space and you can read more books on the way to work .
Simply , you can use the way to work as an additional time for yourself .
What else ?
After work you can go for a drink with your colleagues !
And if the ecology is important for you just think about the pollution .
Let 's reflect one again : is there a future for public transport ?
In my opinion : yes , there is !
Is travelling by car more convenient ?
Well , it depends !
Why using the first narration ?
The first narration can attract readers ' attention at the beginning of the friction and makes the readers get into the thoughts of the madman easily .
We ca n't understand what others think usually , but in this friction , the author invited us know what inside the madman 's mind .
Feeling that the main character is talking to us , as if we were all involved in this case , the whole thing seemed like really happened .
Facing the murder directly makes the horror penetrates into our hearts .
How does the author create a word of horror to his readers ?
The author created the horrible atmosphere by describing the scene , the disordered mind and the sound of heartbeats .
First , the scene that described the murder makes readers ca n't help themselves emerging the images in their mind .
Just like the madman 's plan was happening right in front us .
Then comes to the sound , the heartbeats .
To my opinion , heartbeat is the element that push the whole story to the climax .
Every time when the sound of heartbeats started arousing , something ensued .
In the first time , when the madman heard the heartbeats of the old man , he was going to kill the old man , and he did it .
The second time when madman heard the heartbeats , he became impatient , scared , excited and insane , in the end , he confessed that he killed the man and dismembered the corpse .
At the same time , the heartbeats also dragged the readers nervous and anxious .
Finally , I think the way the author wanted to express the disordered mind of the madman is his intonation .
The whole story except the end of the friction he confessed the crime , the madman 's used the intonation that is extremely calm and steady , to tell the readers the process of the cruel thing that he had done .
The sharp contract for the calm and the cruelty , leaves us a strong impression that the main character was totally insane and crazy .
Shivering inside our hearts , the horror increases .
" Let 's go to the forest to see the variety of animals which are found there " , Max told to his friends one sunny afternoon .
When all was set , they started their trip to the forest .
When they arrived there , they started to look around trying to find different types of animals such as birds , rabbits and deer .
Max and his friends took a walk under the trees when , acroos the river , they saw something that looked like an animal lying on the grass."What 's that ? " , Max said aloud .
They ran quickly , crossed the river and they reached the place where the animal was."It 's a deer ! , its leg is in a trap " , Max 's friend shouted .
When they saw the animal , they could see that it was suffering , so they decided to free the deer .
By this decision , Max took courage to open the trap , but the deer did n't move because its leg was injured .
One of Max 's friend brought water from the river to give to the deer .
Max cut a piece of his T - shirt to cure the animal .
Afterwards , the animal was better and it walked away slowly .
When the day finished , Max and his friends returned home feeling happy because they had saved the animal 's life."What an amazing day ! " , Max whispered to himself as he got into bed that night .
The question is : whether it is possible to be famous without journalists ?
Probably not , but they are many people in show - busines or political life , who are ready to do everything to save their private life .
Generally , people may be famous for two reasons : because of their job or because of their scandalising private life .
If you decide to became famous because of your scandalising private life , it would be silly to complain about tiring paparazzi .
There is a rule , probably one of the most important in public life , that says more or less : ' It is not important what are they talking about you , it is important they are talking about you ' .
Most of celebrities follow this rule , as it is just what they are living for .
That is why they are often able to sell information about their private life .
Real problem starts when journalists injures not the celebrity , but its friends or family .
Paparazzi are cruel in contact with famous people 's children , that may have negative influence on their emotional development .
How about those who do not want to be popular because of scandals ?
In most cases they are just doing their job as well as they can , leading their boring life .
And when finally paparazzi notice that there is nothing interesting in their life , they just leave them alone .
Summarizing , I do believe that adult people are responsible enough to make a decision , if they want to share the most important part of their life with journalists .
And I hope they understand , their duty is to save their relatives .
Great food is probably one of the most valuable pleasures of life .
As a person who loves to eat , I consider environment , quality of food and price as the main factors to decide where should I go .
Last Friday I visited a brand new Mexican restaurant in Lisbon called " Las Ficheras " .
It was suggested by two friends of mine and according to them , because the good food and funny environment .
I went to dinner with more 6 friends in order to having fun and eat good Mexican food after a stressful week .
In my opinion , the food was good but the prices were too expensive considering the quantity served and the messy service .
We faced continuous problems with the order such as : dishes from another table served for us by mistake , the drinks were served with a considerable delay and the bill was shown even without asking ( just because we finished the dinner but our drinks were still on the table ) .
For my luck ( or not ) , I met a friend of mine on the day after that told me that she had dinner at " Las Ficheras " before and in her opinion , as a Mexican , that restaurant was terrible .
She also told me that a great Mexican restaurant was just opened with lower prices and good service .
I got curious about this place and decided to go later .
" Pistola y Corazón Taqueria " was the first Mexican restaurant that I could eat genuine Mexican food , with lower prices and a great service .
They served us " nachos " with tomato sauce for free while we were choosing the main dishes .
After choosing , a bottle of fresh water was served , again , for free .
We chose " tacos " of meat with guacamole sauce and it was absolutely delicious .
After paying the bill , they offered us a shot of tequila to finish our visit confirming that great places still exists .
Hey ! I survived ! ! :)
First of all : THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR HELP WITH THE ARTICLE ! ! !
Second of all , HOW ARE YOU ?
And also , where are you now ? ? :)
In my case ... I 'm much better now . I 'm settled back home and I 'm up and running , even though my uncured sprained ankle has gone worst .
Last week I was borrowed an ankle support and some crutches , so ever since then it 's going better .
Furthermore , precisely today I have started my 15-day rehabilitation sessions !
So I should be back on jumping around in no time :) .
As you know , Malta was a big punch right in the stomach , which for sure I did n't need ! :( .
The course and the organization left much to be desired ; and as if that were n't enough , my scholarship ( funny enough not the ones of the ( only ! ) TWO other participants ) , was not sufficient to cover all the costs ! :/
Anyway , CS and magic saved me right at the last second ( the last night ) , and I left Malta with a smile and a warmed up heart .
And for that I want to THANK YOU once again .
Back home , everything started fast -I should have gotten used to by now , should n't I??- .
So I had n't have time for much .
I have been totally immerse in looking for jobs and in the translation of the scientific paper for a former student of mine .
He decided to finish the second half without my help , so that was a bit disappointing , both for the feeling of not meeting his expectations * and for the ( I 'm guessing , as I do n't know anything as yet :/ ) less money earned that it will mean .
* Sorry , I 'm gon na ( ab)use of your native language skills once again : here " not meeting his expectations " , could be substituted by another expression .
What I doubt is the difference between this bunch : be good enough , measure up , make the grade ; be up to standard / the task .
There again , having a whole bunch of free hours ( days !
From Sunday to Tuesday ) for myself that I was not counting on , proved itself to make wonders ! ! !
I decided to get back home ( I had been the whole week at my friend 's place , as he lives in Madrid and quite close to the writer 's house , where I had been going every day last week ) , and I started getting things done . Plus I gave a rest to my ankle , which was very much needed too !
The two - day one - night trip with my mother and sister went quite well .
The place we were visiting was very beautiful , and haven't been because of the limitations for my ankle , we would have gone for a short hike .
Tomorrow I 'll be starting my first English class , which has taken much longer than I had plan .
I have sent a lot of CVs , and have gone to 3 interviews so far , also for English classes ( one company and two academies ) .
About the pictures from Ramla , could you wait a bit more time ?
I haven't find time to download the pictures ( from ALL THE THINGS that I need to sort out , I was ( and is ) definitely NOT a priority .
Do remind me again , thou , if you see that I 'm forgetting , okay ?
( Please ! ) .
Did you ask Mario about the speakers ?
Because chatting is way faster than writing ;) .
I 'm gon na go now .
Talk to you soon , Mike .
Receive a big hug from ( YES , FINALLY ! ! ) warm Spain .
Global warming and its consequences in 2015
The Guardian 's article " World 's climate about to enter ' uncharted territory ' as it passes 1C of warming " , published on the 9th November 2015 , describes the problems of global warming .
Referring to scientists at the British Met Office , 2015 is going to be the year when the milestone of 1C warming will be broken - caused by global warming - which will lead to unknown consequences on the future .
The World Meteorological Organization made known publicly that 2015 has been the hottest year on record as well as it has caused more carbon dioxide on average by burning fossil fuels .
These problems just announced recently will be issues to talk about at the UN summit in Paris in three weeks .
Then , world leaders will be negotiating about cutting the increased carbon emissions coupled with the El Niño climate phenomenon .
Stephen Belcher , director of the Met Office 's Hadley Centre , claims that humanity is to blame for climate changes as the rise of temperature or the catastrophe expected by scientists when global warming rises beyond 2C. This opinion is also represented by the British Secretary of energy and climate change , Amber Rudd , who considers the climate change to be one of the greatest problems in nowadays ' politics due to its consequences on economy , global security and the fight against poverty .
She stands up for a global deal confirmed on the UN summit by the leading states and therefore these climate targets should be a role - model for other countries .
Furthermore , climate scientist Ed Hawkins expects a continuation of global warming , clarifying this statement with the example of Central England , which has warmed 20% more than the global average .
Global warming in general leads to more natural disasters as flooding , heatwaves , water stress and loss of harvests .
Facing these consequences , a 4C warming would be even more damaging according to Belcher .
Despite the result of a NASA study pointing out that there would have been an ice mass grew in Antarctica from 2003 - 2008 , there is only a small chance of 5 - 10% that this prognosis will come true according to Prof Andrew Shepherd , University of Leeds , as the study has already been proven wrong by 57 other studies .
Although the NASA study shows a different result , the majority of scientists see global warming as a dangerous threat for this planet in terms of living conditions , environment and economy and as well as an issue of the UN summit in Paris .
The problem lies in the outdated framework in which the IWC operates .
Fifteen whaling nations formed the IWC after whale populations collapsed .
The organisation was initially set up to conserve whales only to the extent that they could continue to be used by humans .
The importance of World Heritage properties transcends national boundaries .
Their qualities are extraordinary so that no matter which country they are found in , and who experiences them , they evoke a sense of wonder and admiration .
To be included on the World Heritage List , properties must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one of ten selection criteria .
The World heritage list is important because it attracts tourists and these landmarks are cherished by everyone around the world .
It is also protected by UNESCO because they have found new animals or plants ; there are endangered spices in that area or have a significant importance in history .
World Heritage is the designation for places on Earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity and as such , have been inscribed on the World Heritage List to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy .
The site is the property of the country on whose territory it is located , but it is considered in the interest of the international community to protect the site for future generations .
Its protection and preservation becomes a concern of the international World Heritage community as a whole .
Another advantage for a site to be inscribed on the List is that once a country signs the Convention , and has sites inscribed on the World Heritage List ; the resulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation .
Greater awareness leads to a general rise in the level of the protection and conservation given to heritage properties .
A country may also receive financial assistance and expert advice from the World Heritage Committee to support activities for the preservation of its sites .
The Disadvantages of sites not included in the World Heritage List are that these sites are not funded so they ca n't protect them for risks .
Moreover they remind in the list of sites in danger without to receive assistance .
In my opinion the sites in danger unless they not answer at ten criteria should be protect for UNESCO .
It 's difficult , but I think that it is necessary try to invent new way to finance and defend the natural and cultural heritage .
Cricket is my passion .
I love playing , watching and talking about it .
It 's my first passion and I am following it as far as my earliest memory goes .
Cricket is a team sport which teaches us team work , collaboration and strict discipline .
It also teaches us how to overcome individual weaknesses and gain advantage of others strength to succeed as a team .
I started playing cricket since my early childhood .
Even when I was a kid I started playing with boys of much higher age than me .
It gave me a lot of confidence and a chance to improve my skills rapidly .
I followed cricket religiously and have watched almost every match India played .
Sachin Tendulkar is my favorite cricketer .
I am fan of his batting .
He has broken almost every record in cricket history .
Apart from his cricketing skills I loved his ability to handle pressure and his calm nature in all situations .
If someone wants to learn more about cricket I will advise him to watch batting of great like Sachin , Dravid , Lara and Pointing .
To learn more about bowling one should watch Akram , Warne and Murli .
I will also advise reading more about cricket on cricinfo.com .
It has nice articles , reviews and statistics on many players and games .
Reading biographies of some famous cricketers will also help to understand the insights of the game in deep .
Cricket is going through rough phase due to match fixing and betting scandals .
But I am sure it will come strong out of this and will spread its wings all across the world and once again give its lovers a magnificent show .
I met a friend about one week ago , and he asked me a question that I ca n't stop thinking about : What is on my Bucket List ?
I ca n't stop thinking about it , because I realized that I had never stopped to think about my life in such a deep way .
By the way , do you know what a Bucket List is ?
It is a list of things that you want to do before you die .
I think is kind of sad , that I do n't know what I want to do , I do n't know what makes me truly happy .
About two weeks before I met him I watched a very beautiful movie called " The fault in our stars " .
It 's about a teen couple who are diyng because of cancer , and they have different ways to think about life and death .
This movie has touched me very deeply , it made me think about life and about the way people used to live without apprecciate the really important things .
So after watching this movie and my friend 's question I ca n't help thinking about my life .
Now I have the feeling that I need to live more , but I have no idea what is this " more " .
Before that I had always thought about getting married and having kids as a way to find happiness , but now I think that before this I need to do other things .
It is very interesting to think that it was necessary meet someone new , from another entire different culture to make me think about what I want .
It is very strange that another person became curious about a very profound part of me that I have never thought of .
Well , next November I will travel to Europe , the only certain thing on my Bucket List that I know .
However , now I have an awful feeling about what I am doing today , because for the first time in my life I am sure that I need change something , and I think this " something " is almost everything .
Peoples lives will change in the future , and I bet it 's not for the better .
Unlike popular understandings of History ( and even presumably scientific ones , I must say ) , History is not an unstoppable march towards " progress " , whatever that word means .
It is a ciclical process .
Rome had its hayday in the first century AD , but just three centuries later it was only a shadow of its past .
Those later period Romans were n't even able to make the high quality cement that their ancestors were able to make and have technical mastery over just a few centuries earlier .
And who can safely say that three centuries from now humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and take for granted ?
No one can assure such a thing .
But I do n't think , unless there 's another World War , people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
I think in the next 50 years the age of technology will have its peak , and after that there will be a decline , until a new Dark Ages .
But let 's pick the World War hypothesis for a second .
A wide world war is the only case in which we would see a dramatic change in peoples lives in the time length of 50 years from now .
But there 's , at this day , prospects for a new World War ?
I do n't think so , but on the other hand what the hell do I know ?
The causes that will lead to a new World War may well be in existence right now for all I know , and no one , or only a few very wise and intelligent people know about it .
One day in the future another Franz Ferdinand could be killed , and that symbolic event could serve again as an escuse to some country declare war to another , but the true underlying causes that actually led the countries to wage war against each other would have its roots in much older times .
As the causes of the Second World War had its roots on events that were the outcome of the First War , a Third , hypothetical war , could have its roots on a past conflict that may well have happenned already .
But let 's not digress into that , that 's all another topic that falls beyond the scope of the statement on which I was supposed to write a composition .

From : Simonetta

Subject : holidays are coming !
Hi Sam ,
It has been a long time since we were in touch and now I am very pleased that we are on holiday and we can plan something together .
My family and I are going to spend some days at the same place we went to last year , at the Sunshine Holiday Camp .
Do you remember it ?
I 've already mentioned to you how much fun I had there and why it was great !
It would be terrific if you came with me , is it possible ?
Could you ask your parents ' permission ?
In this Camp parents are calm and do n't worry about their children because they are in the care of a large number of assistants and the camp is situated on an entire island .
In addition , the site was purpose built to provide places fit for young people allowing them to do lots of activities in safety .
There are a wide range of activities promoted by the staff all with the aim of enjoyment , especially outdoor sport activities !
There are two swimming pool , two tennis court , one football pitch , canoeing courses and so on but what I like most is the scuba diving , and the equipment is provided .
The Camp is well - known and opens from May to October and it would be good to book within two weeks , it always get overbooked for the period my parents can take days off , what do you think coming with us from the 1st august to the 15th ?
I am look forward to receiving your answer !
Best wishes .
Simonetta
The doorbell rang unexpectedly . I had fallen asleep on the couch watching TV .
I got up and I made my way to the front door .
Outside stood the most extraordinary - looking man : he looked like a Spanish elephant hunter .
I was taken aback , so I called my mother , who was asleep with her boyfriends .
She came down , but she did not scream .
Instead she started crying .
The man as it turned out was my father , who had been missing for 15 years ...
I did not know that he was still alive .
Mother had always told me he had died in the war .
I think she did this for my own good .
I was very bemused by the situation and did n't know if I liked him or not .
In my dreams I had seen him as an intellectual but now he was in my sitting room and he looked like an elephant or something exotic .
It was very odd to see him in my home .
Now we all live together .
Although the first days were difficult , now we all get on well .
It is great to be a whole family again .
The Grand Place is the central square of Brussels .
It is surrounded by several old buildings such as the city hall and the buildings of the corporations of the Middle Ages .
These were groups of people doing the same work , such as carpenters .
They helped each other and the elders ones taught the youngsters .
Sometimes , they became very rich .
Each building is decorated with the blazon of the corporation .
Their architecture is unique and beautiful .
Today , most of them are hosting cafés , shops and restaurants that attracts a lot of tourists , but there is also the city museum .
The square is covered with pavement and is a pedestrianized area .
It is an important place for the history because it is the oldest Grand Place of Europe and it is a part of the oldest neighbourhood of Brussels which is made of narrow paved streets , old and high buildings and , among other things , chocolate shops .
Recently , several of the buildings have been restored and we can now better see their beautiful gilding and carvings .
Every year , when Christmas comes , there is an amazing show with music and lights on the façades of the buildings while a huge fir tree is placed in the centre of the square .
Wawel Royal Castle is one of the highest ranked monuments in the history and culture of Poland and Europe , so during the stay in Poland it is necessary to visit it .
The first Castle , called palatium , was built in 11th century , the remains of it are still visible inside the walls .
During the next centuries it was expanded , and in 16th century finally rebuilt in a Renaissance fashion , which remained unchanged until today - the most representative remnant is probably famous arcaded coutyard .
During the tour the visitors are shown several room and apartaments , as well as Royal Private Apartaments with far - famed tapestries of Polish ' kings collection .
Another attraction of the tour is visiting the Crown Treasury , where Polish coronation insignia were stored , and armoury .
Apart from the featured , there are also many marvellous exhibitions in the Castle containing its history as well as the other collections .
While visiting Wawel Royal Castle one can not omit seeing Dragon 's Den - a cave under the Castle , where , according to the oldest legends , the dragon of Wawel lived .
I recommend visiting Wawel Royal Castle because of its beauty and uniqueness .
It is a symbol of a thousand years of the Polish history and culture .
Everyone will find something interesting among the variety of exhibitions and tours , and for certain it will be a memorable experience .
I have been learning English as a second language since I was ten years old , which means a very long time ago .
I think I am very lucky then because I have had the opportunity of learning English in a natural way , without books and tough lessons .
My teachers thought it was better to learn by speaking , singing , and doing other activities in English , in a way similar to how we learn our own mother language .
Moreover , I travelled to England and lived with English families for a few weeks every summer since I started learning until I was fifteen years old .
So I grew up thinking I could speak and write quite good English .
Even though I do have little theoretical knowledge about English grammar rules , I can make myself understood in a normal conversation , and I can write an email to a friend without making too many mistakes .
One year ago I decided to take the Cambridge Advanced English exam in order to test my knowledge , thinking It would be not very difficult for me to be successful .
I decided to enrol for a creative writing course in order to practise my writing skills .
Along the course I had to accomplish some writing assignments and submit them to be evaluated by my peers .
And there I realised at least two things : the first one that it is possible to learn how to write better ; the second one that even when you can make yourself generally understood , It is not so easy to be precise .
A magician uses a dove and a black hat , but it would n't be a magic show if he did n't know how to perform the trick .
In the same way I had the ideas and the words but I had to admit that I needed to learn the rules of grammar if I wanted to do the magic trick of precise and stylish writing .
Adolescence .
Everybody say it 's the best period in our whole life ; what they do n't rembember is that it could be also the worst .
Adolescence could be compared to a foggy path and even when it seems you can see something threw it , in reality you do n't .
This awful fog is composed by our uncontrolled emotions .
Everything is unknown , but we try to pretend that we know a lot of things .
This could be one of the reason why we get angry so easily and so often with our parents : every time we descover something new or we say something , they judge us or they begin some long speeches to try to change our ideas .
Another thing about the relationship between parents and adolescents is the fact that they confuse our minds .
As I said adolescents could be very confused and if there 's a thing that get under our skinn is when moms say something and then tell us to do the opposite one .
The worst part is that they get angry with us !
We 're confused , they 're not clear and then they also get angry and they 're surprised when we get mad at them !
It 's true that we should always be respectful but sometimes it turns out to be impossible because they do everything to provoke us .
I think the most important thing in the relationship with our parents is to find a sort of accordance , because in the end we do n't only feel anger for them but also a lot of love .
Love : That 's a new feeling that adolescents have to face .
It 's not the usual love they 're used to feel , as love for family and friends , but it 's a new kind of love .
It 's a kind of love that struggles ; it makes butterflies fly in our stomach , it makes us dive into a sort of imaginary tale .
That kind of love that we see in movies and we dream of ; the type of love that does n't make us fall usleep at night .
It is a period in which we have our first experiences , and it is as scary as exciting .
Adolescence it is like this , there 's a moment that looks magical and in the following one you drown into the dark .
Dear group leader ,
First of all , I would like to thank you for the interest shown to our small village .
I really hope that you have a nice welcome and , please , feel at home .
Here , in Mallorca , there are a lot of places to visit but I will recommend you a unique place , without tourists , noise and crowded beaches .
On the east of Mallorca you will find a small and beautiful village called Artà .
In the municipality of Artà you will find a coaster town , situated on the edge of the mountain range of Llevant .
Sa Colònia de Sant Pere is a traditional fishermen village .
Nowadays , you can still see some fishermen fishing on the seashore .
Here your adventure starts .
In order to get to your destination you must ride a bicycle and just enjoy the splendid panoramic view .
You will ride until Ca los cans , one of the most enigmatical beaches of Mallorca .
This zone is part of a protected area , a natural park .
For that reason , you must go riding a bike or walking .
As Machado said " se hace camino al andar " .
It means that the most important is the way , the journey .
Going on a bike near the seashore with the breeze of the sea is one of the most relaxing experiences in life .
On the way to Ca los cans , you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation .
There are a lot of trees called " tamarells " , native trees of the coast of Mallorca .
Moreover , you will go between two ancient obelisks which have been recently restored .
Finally , you will get to Ca los Cans .
It is a special beach with stones instead of sand and surrounded by trees instead of hotels .
There you can practise different sports .
It is a perfect place to go diving because you can see different fishes , sea urchins and seaweed .
There you can also take a canoe and paddle in the quite sea .
A part from sports , you should note two different culture points .
On the one hand , there is what remains standing of edificatications that were used to keep the small boats of the local fishermen save from storms .
On the other hand , there is a prehistorical tower called " Talaiot " .
The function of the Talaiots is not clear yet .
Maybe it was a defensive tower or an important building for high - class people .
It is important to stay in the beach until the sun goes down .
The sunset in that place is ideal and romantic ( especially if you are with your partner ) and you will see how the sun goes behind the mountain range of Tramuntana .
From that seashore you can see all the Alcúdia bay , part of the mountain range of Tramuntana and the cape of Formentor .
Ca los Cans is a mixture of sea , nature and culture .
I am sure that you will like it and , of course , I need to ask you a favour : Please , keep the secret .
Regards ,
Paula .
Introduction .
The aim of this report is to outline the best and the worst qualities of your centre after one year running .
This report analyses the two main facilities : the gym and the swimming pool .
The gym .
The machines are fantastic and the staff is very helpful with every customer .
On the other hand , the gym is too small .
Every afternoon it is crowded so it is very difficult to do exercise .
The swimming pool .
It is ideal for people who do not compete because of its length , about 20 metres .
Furthermore , it is not too deep , so it is excellent for people who want to learn how to swim .
On the other hand , the changing rooms are too far from this facility , so it is easy to catch a cold when someone goes from one place to another .
Conclusions .
The facilities are quite modern and the staff are excellent but the gym could be bigger .
Furthermore , you would put heaters to avoid colds in the passage way from the changing rooms to the swimming pool .
The Future of Public Transport
When we imagine future , we rarely imagine overcrowded buses and rusty subway trains .
As technologies develop and become cheaper more and more people buy personal cars .
A car allows us to move faster and not to depend on others .
Travalling by car is also much more convenient .
Does this all mean that the years of public transportation come to an end ?
In my opinion , it is not true .
Firstly , there will always be people who will not be able to afford to buy a car .
Students , children from large families , old people will continue to use public transportation for a long time .
Secondly , cars can also turn into public transport .
Science fiction often depicts future as the world where cars are used freely .
Anyone can use the nearest car he or she sees .
Thirdly , people do not have an inborn driving skill , so even in the future children and teenagers will need public transportation .
This is also true for older people , who lose the ability to drive as they age .
In conclusion , public transportation is not likely to disappear , at least during the nearest tens of years .
The chart above gives some information about the average monthly salaries of nurses and doctors in four different countries .
According to the chart , the two countries with the lowest salaries are Country A and Country B.
These ones are called " source countries " , which means that they provide a supply of health care workers to other countries .
Otherwise , the countries with the highest saliaries are country C and country D. Differently from the first two countries , these ones are called " destination countries " because the health care service is provided by foreign and qualified workers .
Moreover , in the first three countries doctors earn about twice as much as a nurse earns , apart from the last country , Country D. In this one , the salary gap between doctors and nurses is bigger than in other countries .
In Country D , the salaries of doctors are about three times higher than those of nurses .
In conlcusion we can say that from the standpoint of the doctors and nurses , working abroad is a much better deal .
Boxing is a common , well known and well loved sport amongst most countries in the world however it is also punishing , dangerous and disliked to the extent that many people want it banned , possibly with good reason .
Boxing is a dangerous sport , there are relatively common deaths , tragic injuries and even disease .
All professional boxers are at risk from being killed in his next fight .
If not killed then more likely paralysed .
There have been a number of cases in the last ten years of the top few boxers having tragic losses throughout their ranks .
This is just from the elite few , and there s more from those below them .
More deaths would occur through boxing if it were banned .
The sport would go underground , there would be no safety measures like gloves , a doctor , paramedics or early stopping of the fight if someone looked unable to continue .
With this going on the people taking part will be dangerous , and on the streets .
Dangerous dogs who were trained to kill and maim in similar underound dog fights have already proved deadly to innocent people , the new boxers could be even more at risk .
Once boxing is banned and no - one grows up knowing it as acceptable there will be no interest in boxing and hopefully less all round interest in violence making towns and cities much safer places to live in , there will be less fighting outside pubs and clubs and less violent attacks with little or no reason .
change the rules of boxing slightly would much improve the safety risks of the sport and not detract form the entertainment .
There are all sorts of proposals , lighter and more cushioning gloves could be worn , ban punches to the head , headguards worn or make fights shorter , as most of the serious injuries occur in the latter rounds , these would all show off the boxers skill and tallent and still be entertaining to watch .
Even if a boxer is a success and manages not to be seriously hurt he still faces serious consequences in later life diseases that attack the brains have been known to set in as a direct result of boxing , even Muhamed Ali , who was infamous ( ? ) both for his boxing and his quick - witted intelligence now has Alzheimer disease and can no longer do many everyday acts .
Many other sports are more dangerous than boxing , motor sports and even mountaineering has risks that are real .
Boxers chose to box , just as racing drivers drive .
In many of the minority works of modern literature , there can be some emphasis on rebellion against oppressive forces .
Although such a show of strength by these works ' characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contribution to the otherwise insightful thought of the author , it is this conflict upon which many stories of ethnic American literature are based .
However , such a rebellion can not be seen clearly in each minority work , and , therefore , the products of ethnic American literature can not be catagorized as merely the result of years of oppression .
Rather , this ever - changing and ever - challenging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individually as both a product of years of struggle and a work inherently distinct from any other .
In the minority works , the conflict and rebellion presented accurately reflects society as a whole , and although the mother 's in The Joy Luck Club rebel against such forces as arranged marriages , Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions , and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from the US government , the characters ' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures .
Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding force between all cultures , for Celie , too , resists her arranged marriage in The Color Purple , and the murderous loves in Jazz reflect Tita and Pedro 's destructive passion in Like Water for Chocolate .
Rebellion and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , but they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .
Emphasis changes with each work , and although figures of authority are particullary oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple , other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters ' responsive action which the previously mentioned works show .
This again implies that these etnic American pieces of literature can not be catagorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences .
How does Voltaire tackle the question of philosophical optimism in ' Candide ' ?
Philosophical optimism -l'optimisme- is the philosophy that everything and occurence is for some good .
Voltaire sets out in Candide to criticise this philosophy .
In Candide the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher employed at Thunder - der - Troncks .
The whole book is a criticism of l'optimisme .
For example when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not concern himself because he know it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier .
Although this would seem to be good it is not because of his training he kills two men , a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then proceeds to kill his sweethearts brother .
Voltaire show his dislike of l'optimisme when Pangloss , Candide and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors , Candide , Pangloss and a sailor .
The storm was caused by an earthquake which destroys the city to which Candide was sailing to .
On arrival they see starvation and death .
Candide is obviously horrified , especially when the sailor begins pillaging the city .
Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Pangloss can only tell him that some good will come of it .
Candide , although remaining true to the ideals of optimism , always appears to be sceptical of it .
This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world , South America , and has to leave his darling Cunégonde with the Commissioner of the province .
Candide can not see what possible good can come of this especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cunégonde 's lovers .
Throughout the book we begin to see how Candide is gradually lead away for l'optimisme or perhaps more importantly how l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair .
The constant belief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant flow of disasters .
Candide 's life , in the book , appears to show this .
He is thrown out of Thunder - den - Tronck because he embraces Cunégonde , he is duped into the army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almost killed as part of an auto - da - fé , he kills three churchmen , he is almost eaten , he finds Eldorado but leaves- the list continues .
Candide 's life is governed by his belief the good will prevail .
Eventually , of course , he does marry Cunégonde but she is not the beautiful young flower that he once loved .
She has become ugly and grew worse by the day .
This illustrates emphatically the folly of l'optimisme .
Candide has travelled the world in search of Cunégonde , with the hope that he will marry her despite all the trouble which he has gone through , of course in the end he does get Cunégonde but at the price of her looks and personality .
Voltaire , in Candide , shows how the philosophy of Optimism is one of despair not hope .
It would be tempting to think of the various European Communities as an embryonic United States of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of European Unity .
However it is important to realise that Europe is a very long way from becoming anything like the United States .
When the original 13 American states resolved to form what is now the United States of America , they were intent on forming a political as well as economic entity .
They were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the newly formed national government to operate as a single international political force .
A balance was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual states as much self - government as possible while ensuring that , for example in military matters , the central government spoke for all .
It is true that today one still hears the old dispute over state sovereignty and attempts to return some power to the individual states , but no - one would challenge the fact that , on matters external to the United States , the government in Washington represents the sole policy - making body .
In Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to see a political union of the countries since this would produce a formidable international military force .
However it is equally clear that while there might be some unified political action flowing from the European Communities ( such as was seen over Europe 's response to the British involvement in the Falkland Islands dispute ) , the Communities were intended as purely economic entities in the first place .
Membership almost certainly involves some loss of national sovereignty , but the United Kingdom could probably leave the community by a simple majority vote in the Westminster Parliament , something which no state in the United States could lawfully do .
We are still a very long way from a Single Parliament for Western Europe with power to make political decisions for all ; and even with 1992 approaching and a single market the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide .
The supremacy of Parliament will never be challanged .
Its ability to make and break any law - made by it or Europe - means that it retains full sovereignty .
Even if today it made laws to that would unite it fully with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty for ever , it could tomorrow repeal all those laws .
The fact that Parliament does not bind itself or can not be bound by any political body means that it can never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population wished it and Parliament consented .
But with the average jingoistic Briton there is no chance of us curing ourselves of our xenophobia and ever wishing to be fully intergrated with Europe .
Even now the channel tunnel has joined us to the continent we still consider ourselves to be separated from the world standing alone against a hostile world .
Naturally , the problems of a single Europe would run as deeply as the benefits that we would presumably ultimately receive .
It seems to me that for the past few centuries , Britain has always considered itself to be detached from the rest of Europe .
Whenever necessary , she has allied herself to European powers , such as in times of war of extreme distrust .
Britain has been eager to maintain a secure balance of power on the continent , but throughout history , she has been more concerned with her oversees empires than with anywhere else .
In the latter half century though , her empire has diminished and she has had to face mounting responsibility in Europe .
Because of her history of isolated sovereignty it is difficult to accept being a part of a single Europe .
For instance , British law is based largely upon precedent , that is judge made law .
We have established a system of law which dates back many centuries , and which is widely known and respected .
There is very little European influence on our law , of course in many respects it will be the same , but the lack of influence will display many differences .
With the creation of a single Europe , new law will have to be accepted throughout the continent , and it will cause both confusion and conflict .
The British tend to be very proud and possessive of the law , and changes may well cause illfeeling and discontent .
Of course , the same points will apply to the monetary system in Europe .
Will there just be one system ?
The country typically is against major change and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it was to be altered .
Our individual monetary system I suppose , could be seen as a symbol of sovereignty .
It can be said that if a single Europe was created , problems may arise over its fundamental political concepts .
Of course Britain would lose her sovereignty , as would the other nations of the union .
It has been suggested that the Single Union could be based on a basic federal structure , whereby local autonomy could be saved , but the union as a whole could work together in a democratic manner .
To a certain extent , even if sovereignty was lost , some national personality would be preserved .
The fact is that , when united , European unity would still in essence be divided .
There will always be aspects of one society that the others will never accept .
Europe as a whole faces the same problems , and therefore , if a single Europe was created , uniting Britain , the problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently .
If the Federalists achieved their aims in a European unity , they would do their best to achieve democracy and promote it nationally , so that individuality is preserved , and that all of their positive features will be known .
The problem facing the British , really results from their isolated past .
The sovereignty of the nation has deep roots , and the fears of losing it are very great .
Whether this would happen awaits to be seen , and would depend completely on the terms of the union , and the negotiations and feelings of the general public and the politicians leading the countries .
With 1992 now only a year away , the question of what a Single Europe will mean for Britain becomes increasingly relevant .
I firmly believe that the advent of 1992 will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain .
This loss need not however be negative .
In fact , in political , economic and defence terms I feel this realocation of resources can and will be very positive .
Whilst to a certain extent I may be guilty of having an island mentality , I would n't go as far as to say Britain is in danger of handing all control over to faceless beaurocrats in Brussels or Strasbourg .
Throughout the world a wind of change is apparent , but especially so in Europe .
This process will continue and Europe the rest of the world will evolue with or without the participation of Britain in this process .
It is my belief that Britain must be involved in the decision making which will eventually decide the new world order .
However to be fully involved , sacrifices have to be made .
Such sacrifices will involve certain aspects of our sovereignty .
In relenquishing and thus centralising certain powers , the aim is not to diminish the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world stage .
As amply demonstrated by recent events in the Gulf , European cooperation in the field of defence can be both impressive and effective . Whilst I would be reluctant to hand over all control to defence to any central body .
I can see a future for some form of European rapid reaction force .
Whilst to an extent crippling defence costs could be cut this would not necessarily lead to a reduction in the size of defence available .
In political terms , regardless of legislation , Britain like the rest of Europe is becoming increasingly cosmopolitan in terms of the population composition .
The North Sea will increasingly come to represent a mere puddle as people move between countries .
I feel it is important for Britain to join fully with its European partners to adapt to these changes in demography .
Politically we are moving closer together .
Possible problems should be studied and solved if possible before they happen .
E.R.M. is already upon us but in this area I feel Britain should be especially careful .
Whilst not pretending to fully understand this system I do know that no system can lower interest rates , and inflation while raising growth , with the possible exception of the Magic Circle .
In the area of the single currency , again I feel this is inevitable .
What is important is to base this currency on the strong currencies within the EEC as opposed to an average based system .
To conclude I would say a single Europe is already happening and that it will continue to do so is guaranteed .
Britain must not concern itself with loss of sovereignty but gain of the European equivalent .
If we miss the boat I think we will drawn before the next boat comes .
When the treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 , the foundation was laid for a new " continent " - a united Europe .
It was said that Europe would not be created quickly , but over several years .
When Britain entered the European Community in 1973 after a national referendum , the debate began concerning Britains relationship with Europe .
When 1992 was set as the date for the single European Market , the debate flared up again , but over how far Britain should be integrated .
The rest of Europe seems prepared for 1992 but Britain seems to be decidedly hesitant .
The former Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher was not been to lead Britain into a United Europe because she felt it would lead to a loss of our sovereignty .
There is no doubt an integrated market would have multiple benefits for the countries involved .
Businesses and other trading organizations are preparing themselves for 1992 , and the single market .
Trade will be easier , with no frontier controls allowing free flowing transportation of merchandise .
There will be business booms and free competition with the removal of protective practices , along with greater freedom to travel .
Many Britons would consider Europe has affected Britain too much already , with decimalization , the new Euro - passports and now the pound sterling being tied to the ECU .
They may feel Britain is being pulled into Europe .
Further changes are forecast for Britain , effecting day to day matters , to create a " European Standard " .
This may make Britons resentful of Europe and tired of " 1992 and all that " .
A single market requires one central institution to co - ordinate all movements of goods and policies .
Will the people of Britain be prepared to give up their government and be directed from Strasbourg or Brussels ? .
Many people would not .
Will the day come when the pound sterling is taken over by the ECU ?
It may well - but will the Britons have a chance to voice their opinions and views ?
Europe may argue that the benefits from a single integrated market would far outweigh any national drawbacks .
As the date draws nearer , the awareness of Britons to Europe must increase .
They must look into the future and consider possible effects .
Will Britain be drawn into Europe against its will ?
Perhaps as more of Britain becomes " Eurofied " , Britons will wake up and see their sovereignty is being taken away .
Britain has never geographically been a part of Europe .
We are in the EEC and we should be able to benefit from free trade .
We have been an island for too long - being independent and able to stand alone .
We have a sound democratic process , which many people would not want to give this up .
A fully integrated market with Britain as a full member would be to the detriment of our political system and consequently leading to a loss of sovereignty .
There has been such a lot of talk about a Single Europe in recent years that it is hard to believe that it will be upon us very soon .
Now that it is a reality , and not just a probability , the question in the minds of many Britons is indeed : Will this mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain or the birth of a nation ?
Firstly , a positive approach .
Looking at things from an economic perspective , this is not a problem .
The benefits in terms of cost - cutting owing to doing things once , instead of twelve times , will be enormous .
Firms , because of being able to pool their resources , will be able to devote more time to research and development , and thus products will improve .
Europe will therefore be a nation to be reckoned with as regards competition .
To look at things on a more individual level , every member of the new Single Europe 's standard of living should increase .
A greater potential of ideas from a greater number of experts will , in theory , result in more knowledgeable and better - informed individuals .
Simplicity is one of the Commission 's key aims , with the idea that if things are simpler and more easy for everyone to understand people will be happier , get on better .
If this is so , they should also work better .
Ideally then , there should be more equality , less crime , greater productivity and greater economic growth .
On the other hand , will this Single Europe mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain ?
It must be remembered that not only does Britain have a small population compared to the majority of the other member states , but it is an island - which none of the others are .
Why should this matter ?
Well , Britain has quite a history and therefore a fair number of traditions .
It is possible that it could become engulfed in the new Single Europe and lose its identity .
Britons ( especially those from older generations ) may then feel " lost " and that they do not really " belong " any more .
The new Single Europe may be too new and unknown for them to make their allegiance to it .
Then there is the question as to whether all this idealism really will work .
Will there be greater prosperity , better - informed , happier citizens , or will this never come off because of politicians being unable to agree on policies ?
Britain , although small , is more often than not in the fore of international matters , taking a definite stance on what it considers to be right .
Has it then not got quite a lot at stake , its character at least , in integrating itself into this Single Europe ?
No one would dispute that this is a difficult question .
The fact remains however that next year ( in 1992 ) there is going to be a Single Europe .
This , as everyone is well aware , is not going to be achieved with ease , but the more tolerant every member state is of each other , the more successful the Single Europe will be .
It is up to Britain therefore to accept this fact and to show an example by leading the way as regards tolerancy .
Then we will all be able to look at the future in a more positive way .
The European Community is a unique grouping of twelve sovereign European Member States who are committed to the development of closer economic and political co - operation .
The community has an aim to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe .
In particular , the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frontiers ; movement not only of goods but of services , capital and people .
However , the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much debated one ; to what extent should a member hand over its sovereignty to the Community , if at all ?
Let us look at the founding of the European Community , before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in more detail .
There were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World War , but only after Europe had again been devastated by war was the futility of national rivalry truly apparent .
The political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re - ordering of Europe .
This fresh start came about because of three main factors .
Firstly , was Europe 's realization of her own weakness , after having lost her age - old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union .
These superpowers were economically , militarally and politically stronger than the divided individual European states .
Secondly was the conviction that military conflict should in the future be avoided ; after all , the two great wars had both begun as European " civil wars " . Thirdly was the common desire for a better , freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way .
One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community , in 1958 .
Its membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty - three .
One of the most innovative features of the European Community compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its own sovereign powers , which it can use to adopt acts , having the force of national law .
This novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called " integration " .
The 1970 's saw progress in integration , with the introduction of community policy instruments , which enabled greater scope for national policies .
All of the member states agree in principle to the idea of a single market by 1992 , however each wish their own interests to be safeguarded .
This is to say that none want to sacrifice their national sovereignty , many want unanimous voting , not majority voting .
Many see this issue as a threat to their own regulations and laws , and could foresee a drop in standards if they do not stand firm .
The situation is seen as a threat to the countries in question who do not wish to boldly give up their sovereignty for the sake of European unity .
Whether or not the continuation of the progress in the field of European unity is sucessful depends very much on the people of Europe .
If a feeling of European unity develops and can be sustained , the threat will subside as a feeling of identity takes over .
On Britains roads there is an ever increasing volume of traffic .
The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hold - ups and traffic jams ..
To remedy this the government has started adding a fourth lane on some streches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses , with mixed reception .
While the road system is being improoved there seems to be an endless series of roadworks which restrict the highways and cause further delay while the roadworks are in place .
The inability to cope with the ammount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic .
It might seem an easy soloution to this mayhem would be to use public transport ; i.e. the Railways .
People are not taking to the Rail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privitisation of different areas .
It has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route !
The main disadvantage with the railways is as the rail service and the bus service are normally owned by different companies it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train .
If the services were integrated there would be a bus time table which coincided with the train arrival times .
Then people would be more likely to catch the train as they would not have to look forwards to a long walk , wait for a bos or an expensive taxi ride .
My soloution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services , this would get people of the roads and onto the trains .
To improove the rail service trains have got to be timed to arrive and depart at key times i.e. arrive at eight o'clock and leave at half past six .
The train and bus companies have to liase with each other and the train fares have to remain relatively cheap i.e. the same price or less as it would cost to go by car .
The basic dilema facing the UK 's rail and road transport system is the general rise in population .
This leads to an increase in the number of commuters and transport users every year , consequently putting pressure on the UKs transports network .
The biggest worry to the system is the rapid rise of car users outside the major cities .
Most large cities have managed to incourage commuters to use public transport thus decreasing major conjestion in Rush hour periods .
Public transport is the obvious solution to to the increase in population if it is made cheep to commuters , clean , easy and efficient then it could take the strain of the overloaded British roads .
For commuters who regularly travel long distances rail transport should be made more appealing , more comfortable and cheaper .
Motorways and other transport links are constantly being extended , widened and slowly turning the country into a concrete jungle yet it is only trying to cope with the increase in traffic , we are our own enemy !
Another major problem created by the mass of vehicle transport is the pollution emitted into the atmosphere damaging the ozone layer , creating smog and forming acid rain . Tourturing the Earth we are living on .
In concluding I wish to propose clean , efficient comfortable and cheap public transport for the near future .
The modern traffic jam is now a familiar situation to nearly all of the western worlds population .
If every time we use our cars to travel any distance we find ourselfs in a 10 mile tail - back why do we still insist that that we travel in such ameander .
To illistrate my point , if every time you took a train , it stops for 2 hours on the track , everyone would stop taking it .
So why do we still insist on travelling on the road .
The answer most likly lies in 2 areas , firsty the attitude of many westerners is that " it is their right to travel in such a mannor ' .
I am by far and away no ' greeny ' who wants to make everyone live in tipee 's and eat soya bean soup , however I do agree that somthing should be done about the volume of traffic that is on our roads today .
The governments answer to the considerably growing amount of traffic on our roads it just to back move , they are not even attempting to treat the cause , thent more and more people are now driving .
We all feel that we have a divine right to be on the road .
Why ?
Do we , the westeren world ( 5% of the population of the world ) , have the right to use the resources of the rest of the world at the environmental cost ?
Just beause we can not be bothered to get out of bed a bit earilene to catch public transport .
Even if we did , then shorly so does the rest of the world .
That could have disasterous implications .
The 2nd reason , is the promblem that the public transport service , for example rail , is declining so much , there is no train to catch in the morning .
People stopped using trains because of the fall in standards , these people were forced onto the road , routes became unprofitable and so were closed and services cut back , forcing more people onto the roads .
The whole system has now formed a spiraling circle of road use .
This has now been intensifyed with the sale of the railways , to privite rail companys , profit motivated .
The vital , small rail links may now be closed , priviously they where subsudised to make up the loss , now the privite companies can not afford to do this so many will close , cutting off small towns and villages .
The only way to stop the circle will be to break it , the only people to do this is the government or ourselves , If we make the effort to use public transport it will expand into a good service ; Unfortunatly the public seam to be appethetic to this idea .
Today , boxing has become a very popular sport , with T.V. channels competeing for coverage of certain events and fighters earning a lot of money , this is a big business .
Apart from athletics , boxing seems to be the only popular international sport from which Britain can still hold to head high .
We have superb fighters with excellent character such as Lennox Lewis , Nigel Benn , Nasheem Hamed and our beloved Frank Bruno .
Despite being enjoyable to watch , boxing is very dangerous .
Blows to the head can cause the brain to rattle about the skull which may cause a brain clot or tumor .
Last year , the fight between Chris Eubank and Micheal Watson led to calls for boxing to be banned when Micheal Watson slipped into a coma and was in a critical condition for some months .
Many youths in low income areas see boxing as ' a way out ' , a chance to make it to the top and earn a lot of money on the way .
There are , however , people who regard boxing as barbaric , brutal and primitive .
These people argue that there is no need for boxing and that it only promotes violence .
During the fight , yes , of course it is violent , but this is controlled violence and fighters have a mutual respect for each other .
All precautions are taken to ensure a safe fight .
During fights doctors a kept close to the ring and have the authority to call it off prematurely if required .
Ambulances are also kept on stand by at big events .
Although it may sound cruel , I do not beleive that any fighter has entered a proffessional boxing career without knowing the risks .
Because there are so many budding young boxers , to ban boxing would be insane , since it would almost certainly go underground .
Underground fights are far more dangerous since less protective gear is used and there usually is n't a doctor present .
Taking this into account and considering that boxing is about hurting the opponent , it can be said that boxing is a relatively safe sport .
Although far less popular , there are other sports which are far more brutal and dangerous , such as ' Thai Boxing ' , where competitors are encourage to use their knees and elbows .
The argument continues , but for the sake of safety in the long term I do not think boxing will be banned .
Which is good news for the majority of the British public .
Two men , one ring , only one can leave . Dramatic it may be but basically that is the main principal of boxing .
Although throughout the years rules have been made to dilute the sports sadistic side , should boxing be banned ?
Every time a boxer gets punched in the head his brain moves vigorously inside his skull .
This causes the boxer to lose many brain cells per boxing fight and if this occurs frequently then the boxer can end his career with brain damage .
In my eyes and probably the eyes of others this is reason enough for the banning of boxing .
The sport to say the least is actually a blood sport , the simple reason being that the idea of the sport is to ' knock your opposition out ' , although this is argued by Chris Eubank he believes he is a sportsman and the idea of boxing is an art form , he says that he does not specifically go into a boxing ring to knock his opponent out but to win on points differences and to give Chris Eubank his just respect most of his fights have been won on points .
But there is one exception - the original example , the first reference why boxing should be banned , the tragic accident where Michael Watson was put into a coma by Chris Eubank ( the man who does n't specifically go into fights to knock his opposition out ) .
This example only proves too well what a dangerous so called ' sport ' boxing is .
The boxing federation is trying to do as much as it can to make the ' spot ' safer having rungside doctors , banning bare hand fights but the top and bottom of the argument is that any blow to the head causes considerable damage .
There is always much speculation over the dangers of such a brutal sport as boxing .
This is emphasised and exaggerated when a competitor in the sport tragically dies .
A recent death in the ring has inevitably led to a public uproar on the safety of the sport , and the controvesy over whether the sport should be banned or not is yet again the forefront of discussion .
Let us consider how a professional boxer would feel .
He is clearly aware of the dangers and brutalism of the sport , which is possibly why he enjoys it so much .
I have yet to hear any boxer regret his choice of career .
The excitement of being in the ring , the joy at knocking an opponent onto the canvass , and all the money that is there to be made are overwhelming factors which keep boxers fighting .
The money that is there for the taking for the very best of the best is ridiculous , and with some top boxers earning sums of money such as £ 20 million ( or in Mike Tysons comeback case , $ 60 million ! ) it is hardly surprising how important the sport can be to some .
Let us consider ' Sky ' viewes , recently beginning a subscription to view Tysons " next Live Lights " .
This member of the public does not want the sport to be banned either .
Now let us consider the friends or family of a boxer , who has been permanently injured ( or been killed due to a fight ) .
These individuals and others learning about the tragic incident in the media protest against the sport .
The family , who were originally against the idea of their son finishing college early to take up the sport would be leading the protests againt boxing .
How pleased , proud and patriotic the British public felt when Frank Bruno achieved his ultimate goal and became the Heavyweight champion of the world , yet how sorry many were to see him return to boxing after his head injuries earlier in his career .
This hypocritical view is shoved by so many that whether boxing should be banned or not will remain a controversial issue for the forseeable future .
There were 2 main objections raised against the introduction of the national lottery .
The first was the objection that the lottery would be little more another form of taxation , in fact , none than that , a tax on the poor .
The second and main objection came from charities who predicted that charitable donations would go down with the introduction of the lottery , as people would be less likely to give money to charity , instead buying a lottery ticket , with the excuse that some of the money spent buying the ticket would go to charity .
There was also some controversy over the awarding of the lottery organisation franchise , which eventually went to Camelot , which was not seen as the strongest contender for the bid : other companies or consortiums promised to give more money to charity with lower running costs .
Richard Bronson promised to give all of his profits to charity , but was rejected .
My personal objections to Camelot as the lottery organiser is that a large proportion of the consortium are american or foreign firms , for example IBM has a sizeable stake in Camelot .
The British national lottery run by non British firms .
since its introduction there has been more controversy over the national lottery .
When it promised to give 45 pence in every pound to charitable causes , it neglected to promise that most or all of this money would go to charity .
There has also been some controversy over the allocation of money .
For example 3 million pounds were given to Eton college one of the richest public schools for a gymnasium money was also given to the royal opera house .
The lottery seamed to be a reverse Robin Hood : stealing from the poor to give to the rich .
The lottery has also suffered alegations that it is addictive , especially with the introduction of scratch cards .
It has been claimed that it is so addictive that people will spend all their availiable cash on lottery tickets , only to be disappointed .
It has been calculated that only 4 pence out of every pound recieved by the lottery goes to charitable causes , the rest is tax the prize fund , profits , and the so called charities .
It has also been calculated that the chance of winning anything substantial is one in millions , ie highly unlikely .
It has also been alleged that the jackpots are too high most of the lucky winners have said themselves that the jackpot had runed their life , alenating them from friends and family .
In conclusion , I think that the lottery should be retained , but not in its present form . I think that jackpots should be capped at 2 million pounds , and the prize fund shared between more people : it is better to give forteen people a fortune than to give fourteen fortunes to one person .
I would also remove any american buisness interests and give the charity money to more diserving ' charity ' .
Now the lottery is in place , it would be very difficult to remove it from society .
The computer has been one of the most influential inventions of all time .
Computers now dominate the majority of government business , science and communication , as well as many other areas of human life .
In many ways , it has taken the place of the human brain in performing calculations and thought processes .
The most obvious example of this is the calculator , an instrument used by mathmeticians and scientists for making numerical calculations .
This has made it no longer necessary for the human to perform calculations and run through equations , and so need not understand the principles behind them any longer .
This , unfortunately , means that the genius scientist is being replaced by the powerful computer and its operator , who needs only to know which buttons to press .
This may seem an extreme view , as there is still much in the world of maths and science which a computer can not calculate , but this may not be the case centuries into the future .
Computers have been used as a means of keeping records , they have all but superseded handwritten text , ( in a few decades people may well be faced with a computer screen and keyboard in their General Studies exam ) , they are used to transfer money across the globe , even to create artwork and to entertain .
Computer generated pictures , including ' fractal ' pictures , drawn from equations , seem to be more popular than hand printed images from an artist 's imagination , and computer games seem to provide more entertainment than any game or activity that takes place in the real , physical world .
Virtual reality allows people to have ' 3-D ' entertainment created for them by a computer .
Whether or not the computer is taking over from the human brain , it has certainly made the human body all but redundant .
People , businesses or corporations can be contacted at any point around the globe by fax machines , e - mail and the internet , and some people prefer these forms of communication to actually meeting face to face .
Money can be transferred instantly without even needing to move the actual money - the physical coinage does n't matter , it is the computer records that state how much each bank has ownership of .
However , the idea that the human brain is no longer useful is not entirely true ( ! ) Computers can not deal with human beings , have no capacity for coping with anything outside their expected situations , and can not adapt to new situations using judgement .
Human beings often act without logic or reason , and only other human beings can cope and deal with that .
Also , computers can break down , and then a human is needed to take control - such as an airline pilot , and there are still certain tasks only a human being can perform , and they are often among the simplest .
They cried , they cheered .
Their faces expressed joy , triumph , pride and perplexity .
The world watched in anticipation -- We were mesmirized by the images of the TV , expecting something new at every moment and not wanting to miss it -- I remember that day it was the only topic of conversation at school : " Have you heard ? " , " I ca n't believe it ! " , " After all this time ! " , " I never thought it would happen .
" We all felt that we were living one of those historic moment that you read about in a history book and were proud to be a part of it -- It was November 9 , 1989 , the day that the Wall fell in Berlin-
Within a few weeks , the excitement had died down and people had turned their attention to more recent news .
But for me , this had been the start .
It was the start of what our now as - President Bush likes to refer to as " our " winning of the Cold War --
It was the event that gave the people of the Eastern Bloc countries the hope that their efforts were not in vain -- For 40 years , the people had suffered under a communist regime that had not allowed them to express themselves freely or to leave their homelands in search of a new life -- Many people had tried to escape .
Some had been executed -- I had a classmate whose father had escaped from Hungary -- He had left his family and friends , his whole life and had set out for Western Europe with little money .
I had asked him once if he had n't been scared , scared of what he would find once he left --
He told me that nothing could compare to the way he had been forced to live his life there -- Even though I had lost touch with this classmate , her father 's words were with me as I watched the events unfold in Germany --
Bolstered by the Germans ' success , the people of Hungary , Tchekoslovaquia , Poland and Roumania rose against communist regimes as well -- Now , three years later , communism as we once knew it no longer exists .
Whether the people are happier or not , I can not say --
However , they will have at least seen the " other side " .
Their struggles and hopes of forty years will not have been in vain -- Without the " events of Berlin Wall " history probably would not have taken a very different course -- Eventually , I think that things would have turned out as they did --
However , history can not be rewritten and as things stand the Fall of the Berlin Wall actively contributed to the resurgence of hope and struggle in the rest of the Eastern Bloc -- As such , it was the catalyst force that led to the end of the Cold War and therefore , though we may not always remember the other significant events , we will always remember the day the wall fell --
The development and implementation of technology has affected societies in every corner of the world .
I do not speak of a certain object in particular , but of technology as a whole .
This thing , technology has been and will always be both the closest friend and yet the greatest Nemesis of our world .
Science and technology have allowed me to travel to this part of the world , they have provided a living for my family , they have cured my grandmother of cancer , and they provide horizons of hope and knowledge in the fields of medicine , science , engineering , and even the less overt corners of our lives .
The use of the means humans have developed is wherein the greatest problems lie .
Speaking from my experience living in the United States , I have come to feel that technology has become a large detriment to our youth in particular .
People say that technological development has made our world much smaller ,
and I would concur that a great majority of Americans live in their own personal closets .
In schools , Geography classes rarely , if ever , exist .
Before I came to Spain , a group of children asked me if Spain was in Michigan .
Explaining that Spain was located across the ocean did not seem to improve their understanding of the layout of our world .
Science and technology have had effects on the U.S. that can not be described , and I feel that its people have adopted the same " I am a self - sufficient- I do n't need any help " type of mentality that will slowly destroy us .
Our awareness of other people , other cultures , and other languages is very low on the priority list of our educators .
Until I was 15 , I was unable to study any foreign language at all , and even at that time I had only one choice of languages- German .
Since I was twelve , I had an intense desire to learn Spanish , and because of these circumstances , that I mentioned before , I had no choice but to wait until I was twenty years old to even begin to learn this language .
Mine is not the only experience like this .
Many people argue nowadays that , with the advent of computer technology , our mental arithmetic is poor and we are becoming a nation of couch potatos .
It is true in a way , the development of portable calculating machines ( calculators ) has meant that we no longer need to be able to work out sums in our heads , but at what cost ?
In many shops , the cashiers appear to be dumbfounded by the simplest of sums without the aid of their tills .
In many areas , the skill of human judgement has been replaced by faster , more accurate , computers .
Many people have had their job positions taken over by computers .
Filing cabinets are becoming a thing of the past with computer databases .
But even such menial tasks as filing are good for us .
They encourage organisational skills and tidiness .
When people talk about artificial intelligence ( AI ) , you hear many funny tales from people who are convinced that the computers are coming alive and will eventually rule us .
These are just the rantings of people who have nothing to do with computers and who do not realise that behind every computer is a programmer .
Even ' artificial intelligence ' needs to be programmed .
Human brains still work out how to build the computers , how to program them and , more importantly , how to control them .
As for making the human brain redundant computers can help to improve learning skills , they can teach , test and improve our linguistic skills .
Reflexes are improved ( and this has been scientifically proven ) by playing computer games , the very same things that parents say turn their children into ' zombies ' .
We can expand our imagination and convert our ideas into computer simulated models , enabling us to design buildings and road networks .
The computer revolution has not made our brains redundant , it has opened up areas of them we never knew existed !
It is now the age of the computer .
Almost everyone owns a computer or has access to one .
Computers nowadays are a far cry from the one 's in the past which filled whole rooms .
They are able to generate amazingly accurate graphical representations and perform extremely difficult mathematical equations in just seconds .
Computers have become a huge part of our lives in both the areas of work and education .
But are they such a good thing ?
When calculators came along a drop in ability of students for mental arithmetic was obvious and now they are used for the simplest calculations .
The computer could do the same thing .
Computers encourage laziness in the general public , why work out something yourself when the computer can do it for you .
This is very time saving and efficient but it is causing people to forget basic ideas .
For instance , spelling is no longer as important as it was you can simply use a " spellcheck " to correct your English , which is absurd .
For the youth of today computers offer links around the world and millions of facts and figures .
This could be argued to be educational .
They should be out enjoying themselves and gaining experiences for themselves instead of reading about them on a flat screen .
It is said that you can meet people through computers and have ' relationships ' .
I find this preposterous and people are losing the ability to communicate and form relationships .
Computers can offer escape from the hum - drum routine of daily life by means of games but they are mind - numbing and un - inventive .
There is however a more dangerous threat from computers , it is that they can do the work for man .
This could lead to high unemployment .
Those people who work with computers for long periods of time every day face problems .
The repetion of tapping keys all day and staring at the screen can be harmful and not only that it is highly boring to do the same thing over and over again .
Computers may be the future but what part will man have in this future .
There will be no need for people to go to school as they could be taught at home , people would hardly ever talk and the only career available would be for computer programmers .
I agree that computers are helpful but people should not live through their computers and be so reliant on them .
They should read books and live more in order to regain their lost imagination and sense of adventure .
Also , in schools I feel that work should be done mainly by hand and calculators and computers should only be used minimally in mathematics in order to stop the production of computer addicts and again have normal people .
There are many beneficial aspects of genetic manipulation .
These include : the erasion of identification of harmful hereditary genetic disorders and the development of hybrid high - yield crops .
There can be no doubt that genetic manipulation and genetic engineering have had highly beneficial effects on many areas of society .
However , many people dislike or are prejudiced against , genetic manipulation .
Partly this is a ' Fear of the unknown ' ; something which tampers with the intrinsic components of plant and animal life is beyond comprehension for most people , and therefore provokes fear .
What people have also become aware of , is the immense power which genetic manipulation can give to certain individuals .
This has been very good to feed popular culture ( the film ' Jurassic Park ' being an obvious reference point ) .
There is also however , the very real possibility that the power of genetic manipulation could become the possession of uncontrolled unregulated individuals who could use it for ' evil ' purposes .
This then , is an argument against scientists bearing moral responsibility for their work .
Anything in life can be misused .
Whether it be a kitchen - knife used to stab someone , a car used to run someone over , or something as harmeless as a pillow used to suffocate .
Everything in life , if misused , can have harmful effects and genetic engineering and genetic manipulation are no exception .
Though the possible effects of genetic manipulation may be far larger than a kitchen - knife or car , this is purely a subjective view by present - day standards .
Certainly we would not hold the makers of a car or kitchen - knife responsible for their misuse , and there is no reason why scientists should bear the major burden or responsibility if genetic manipulation is put to misuse .
The fundamental flaw in saying scientists must bear the major burden or moral responsibility for their work , is that if this had been applied universally for centuries , scientific research would never have taken place , and mankind would be without electricity , radios , quite simply , anything above the mud hut ' existence .
Scientific research is not a corrupt , but an essential and natural part of the human condition for bettering itself .
The other fundamental flaw is assuming that individual scientists have responsibility , Science is a process of discovery rather than creation , ie .
no - one created genetic manipulation , the power of it was there to be discovered .
If one scientist does not make a discovery then another one will .
It is unfair to hold responsible the scientist on the fore front of human knowledge , who discovers something when another scientist in another part of the world may make the discovery independently afterwards .
The only argument for making scientists responsible for their work , is that quite often , and particularly in the case of genetic manipulation , it would need a scientist to misuse knowledge , and therefore they should be responsible .
While genetic manipulation is relatively new , it takes a scientist to carry it out , and therefore an individual scientist could be held responsible .
But , once genetic manipulation becomes common - place in the future , and it is not only the domain of scientists , the originals scientist who discovered genetic manipulation can not be held responsible for other 's misuse of it .
There are many problems facing the Monarchy .
Some of them are listed below :
The divisions in their family and the fight between prince and the princes of Wales and the possibility of the divorce .
The other problem is that people say ( or think ) that they do not do anything but they are rich and also they do not pay any taxes .
Another problem is that people think that Monarchy is abolishing in many countries and many countries are republic so Monarchy should be abolished in this country too .
There are also arguments against abolishing the Monarchy too .
For example many people like the royal family or they are honest people not like the politisions that always lay .
I think the royal family and Monarchy is a a tradition in UK and anywhere in the world , UK is known by its royal family , so I do not think it should be abolished .
In the end I think if many people want the Monarchy to be ablished a general election should be called and then see if Monarchy should be abolished .
" In Vitro fertilisation " is the fertilisation of an egg in the laboratory ie . in a testube .
The egg is taken from the mother and placed in an environment which will optimise the chances of fertilisation by the sperm from the father .
Once fertilisation has occured the fertilised egg is implanted back into the mothers womb and from there on the pregnancy will be normal .
Normally more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccesful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a succesful pregnancy .
This usually leads to multiple births ie .
twins , triplets etc .
There are people who are agains this , saying it is not natural and is it fair to the child having started life in a test tube , as they believe life starts from the moment of conception .
There are ethics involved whereby who is given the treatment and who is n't ?
, at what age should the treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitro fertilisation for one person when the same amount of money could be used to saves hundereds of lives by vaccinating people against measles for example .
The people who are for this can argue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their own child .
Women who would not normally be able to have children can now do so with invitro fertilisation .
Through no fault of her own she could have a blocked fallopian tube causing her to be unable to allow eggs down to the womb and it is only fair in helping her to have children .
Technology has progressed quickly and in doing so ethics and practical guidelines have been left behind .
I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations ie .
1 . Fertility treatment should not be given to post - menopausal women .
The menopause is the body 's way of telling you that you are to old and your body is no long capable of bearing a baby .
Last year there was a case of a post menopausal woman who by lying about her age was given in vitro fertilisation ( IVF ) .
I do n't think this is fair or morally correct to the child since her mother would be claiming her pension when she was at primary school and her mother would probably die while the child was in her teens .... there should be a test that is given before ( IVF ) is carried out to check the mother is not past the menopause .
2 .
Eggs should not be taken from aborted foetuses .
The foetuses will have been aborted for a reason for example : if it was the result of a rape or if it had congenital deformities .
There should be a guideline or law stating that eggs should only be taken from the mother and not from dead , foetuses .
Science has moved on dramatically since the C19th .
Many new things have been invented and many things medically have changed .
People in our modern times are now able to have liver , heart and even lung transplants , there are many complications but many are succesful .
People are able to have a whole new blood supply if theirs lacks the sufficient requirements or , a bone marrow transplant if the blood lacks white cells .
All the above are carried out on living people , but nowadays biological operations can be carried out on humans which are not even born .
Bodies can start their days in a test tubes .
This is called ' in vitro fertilisation ' .
This is when an egg is removed from a woman placed in a test tube and then sperm is placed in to the test tube and the egg and sperm fuse together .
The test tube is then incubated for a few weeks and when the fetous is formed , the baby is then inserted back in to the mother .
The fetous is left to grow and develop naturally .
This idea is extremely benificial to married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccesful are able to have children .
An in vitro fertilisation allows the baby to grow inside , which allows the mother and baby to bond and it would feel apart of her , this would not happen if the couple adopted .
What I do feel is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is post - menopausal decides she wants a baby .
Nature has already taken its course to tell her she is too old to have any children so why should she have one implanted into her .
It is not fair on the child because when it grows up and all its friends are playing with their 30 - 40 year old parents , its mother could be drawing her pension and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child .
Also the mother may die of old age before the child has led a full life and this would be unfair to the child .
The child may also have to look after the mother in her old age .
As the fetous begins its life in a test tube , and the sperm is selected , this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected .
The way the sex can be chosen is by using genetics .
The women has 2 X chromosomes and the man has one X and a Y - chromosomes .
The way in which the sex can be selected is that the egg is always X and the sperms nucleus can either contain an X or a Y chromosome .
The X chromosome sperm is slightly heavier than the Y so they can be separated .
If the mother wants a boy Y sperm is selected and if a girl X is selected .
This may lead to an increase in one sex , and a decline in the other .
As a result this would reduce the population as there would be less couples .
Also what happens if most people the year you are born are men and you are a woman , this would be the unpopular sex .
Science is progressing all the time , but is it for the best ?
The main reason for the people of Britain to stop eating beef at the moment is the threat of BSB .
This is a viral disease that attacks the central nervous system which can be passed on through consumsuming the animal .
In cows it is commonly know as mad cow disease and by law any cow showing these signs must be destroyed and not sold for meat .
The problem is however the signs are not shown for a long time , this being a viral disease .
It can be passed on to humans through eating parts of the animal such as the brain which is affected and these parts are usually sold and put into fast foods such as beef burgers .
The rest of the meat however is relatively safe and eating , e.g. a steak offers very little chance of the disease being passed on .
However the British press has ignored this fact and blown the situation out of proportion considering only a very small number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eating beef .
Another reason for the British people to stop eating beef is the push for vegetarianism , although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the former point abut BSB .
These factors could have a considerable impact on the agricultural industry preventing the sale of British dairy livestock not only in Britain but for export aswell .
With global communications as good as they are now , it could send a scare across the world about British Beef - indeed France and Germany already have restricted and someplaces banned the sale or import of British beef for fear of it 's safety .
Although British farmers have learned to diversits , Dairy farming and the sale of Beef products still forms the backbone of British agriculture and would completely change the face of farming in Britain .
Wether they switch to sheep or vegetable crops were made , substantial changes would be needed to change the situation .
People throughout the United Kingdom were , doubtless shocked and perhaps upset by images in the national press and television news of cows who had contracted the disease bovine spungiform encephalapthy , or BSE .
The so - called ' mad cow disease ' seemed to make the cows lose all sense of balance and direction , stumbling around drunkenly .
Herds where this disease was found were put down before the symptoms progressed further .
Those cows which had been put down were not used for food .
The disease infects the cow , and is then present in the spinal fluid within the spine and the brain , and as the spinal fluid is usually spilt in the slaughter of cattle for meat , the risk of contamination of the meat was one the industry was not willing to take .
The human disease , Crentzfeld - Jacob disease , or CJD , is believed to be a human form of BSE , although no clear link has yet been established between the two .
It is unclear whether incidence of CJD is on the rise , or whether awareness of the condition is heightened , but more cases , from all ages have been diagnosed recently , and the disease is always fatal .
The government insists , perhaps correctly , that British beef is perfectly safe to eat .
However , people are genuinely scared of the presence of the disease in the U.K. , and many are abstaining from eating beef .
Many schools have removed beef from their menus , substituting pork and chicken , and sales of beef have shown a decline .
The implications for the beef industry could be rather serious , where everybody to boycott beef products .
To compensate , beef prices have dropped , in attempts to sell more meat , but the public remains sceptical .
If beef continues to fall from favour , then the beef industry 's future would be unclear .
Beef products are present in many foodstuffs such as jellies , fruit gums , and of course stock cubes .
Would all these products have to find synthetic or substitute ingredients ?
Even if the entire beef industry were to grind to a halt , the numerous heads of beef cattle worldwide would no longer be needed , but , being bred as they are , for beef , they would be useless for milk products .
Not all beef can be infected , though , and the situation has become a waiting game .
For beef to be repreived or condemned , we are forced to turn to the scientists to establish whether or not BSE and CJD are linked , and , more importantly , whether the latter can be contracted by eating meat contaminated with the former .
The nation awaits the verdict on tenterhooks , and it is in the majority 's interests that there be no proven link .
Watch this space .
Personally , I believe that it is merely that man is better at diagnosing CJD now than ever before .
Some reports say that it can take up to 20 years to develop , so we could all already have it .
Whatever you believe , I shall continue to enjoy my roast beef and Yorkshire pudding , thankyou .
There has been a big scare in Britain recently that some beef may contain BSE ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) which may lead to the human equivalent of CJD ( Creutzfeldts - Jacob disease ) .
BSE is a disease in cows that effects their brain and spiral tissue ( or offal as it is sometimes known ) .
After a few reported cases of CJD , a similar form of the disease found in humans , it is know thought that ' mad - cow disease ' ( BSE ) is the cause .
Researchers believe that eating beef containing offal will transmit the fatal disease to humans .
This claim has devestated the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eat beef in case they contract the illness .
Already the sales of beef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in Britain they have dropped about 6 % - 7 % .
Although scientists say that to contract CJD part of the cows offal must be contained within the beef .
customers are still reluctant to eat the meat incase it has come from some ' dodgy ' butcher trying to cut costs .
As you can imagine this has had a tremendous inffluence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants where beefburgers are the main item on the menu .
An example of one is MacDonalds where they have immediately brought out a notice stating that their beefburgers are made from 100% of the finest , pure beef and contain no offal .
In my views no half decent restaurant with a good reputation would risk buying poor beef in case a customer caught CJD and they managed to trace it back to the restaurant .
An outcome like this would mean they would be sued for several thousands of pounds and would probably have to sell up .
As a result of a lower beef demand in places of food production there would be a lower need for beef cows .
This means that there would be an excess of beef ( or a beef mountain ) that could not be sold .
Because of this the prices of beef would have to decrease in order to attract more customers .
So , as a result of the claim that beef containing contaminated offal may cause CJD in humans , farmers ( in particular beef farmers ) are losing out as they will have to sell their meat for a lower price due to the low demand .
As a result they may have to diversify towards other areas such as crops , milking cows , etc . or even have to get a government subsidy .
I feel that the evidence that BSE causes CJD was not strong enough before the claims were released .
It has therefore caused an unnecessary , deleterious effect on the agricultural industry and beef market .
The question of compensation for services rendered is never so simple as remitting a predetermined salary based on qualifications and a person 's dedication to the task at hand .
If one has preconceived notions concerning one 's salary , one will certainly be disappointed since some employers are sure to value their skills and abilities less than others . "
Contribution to society " is subjective and therefore impossible to compensate " equally ' .
In the 1920s in American , it became very popular to disdain people who did not actually work for a living , but merely lived off the interest of their investments .
The stock market was experiencing a boom , and several formerly working - class citizens became wealthy and relished the idea of retiring early .
But several great authors of that period questioned the right of these investors to effectively live as parasites ; they received money , but they contributed nearly nothing to society .
People who inherit money or live off the interest of investors often seem to spend their time in search of a new thrill , some sort of excitement that money can not buy .
Having almost unlimited wealth changes people , both those who are born into wealth and those who earn their own money early on .
But do they have the right to live this way ?
What about people who work very hard yet they seem to be paid miserably .
A migrant work may slave away in a field all day long and make less money in a day than a wealthy person spends on a tip at lunch .
The answer this question lies in one 's feelings about Democracry .
Some would argue that if a person is smart enough or lucky enough to earn money for an early retirement ( or for their children 's inheritance ) he or she is entitled to it .
A rather hard view would be that if someone who works on a menial or physically taxing job does not make a fair or moderate salary then it is his or her own fault ( or bad luck ) .
These opinions are based on a rather faulty American premise that all people are given an equal chance in life and what they make of it is their own responsibly .
Apparently , most people believe that they are underpaid and that others are overpaid .
For instance , everyone seems to think that doctors make much too money for the work they do , yet none of the doctors are lowering their fees ( they must think that it 's a fair price ) .
So , unless we wish to impose on the personal lives of wealthy people by making them work harder , or give people who are not wealthy money that society does not believe they deserve , we can not give pay equal to contribution to society .
I agree that in the past women have had problems with societies role of what they are expected to do in the work place and at home .
Women have been looked down on if they try to get ahead and pay has differed with the same job for a man verses a woman doing the same job .
Gone is the age that the woman is required to stay home .
Now a lot of women work and the ones that want to stay home do it because they want to .
A lot of what has changed women 's roles is the feminists .
These are groups of people that have defended women over the years .
These people have shown the modern world what women in the work place can do .
The problem is that these feminists have not looked at all women .
Some women were happy with old traditions , some wanted a bit more in their lives , some wanted a lot more in their lives .
What happens is that all women have to go along with these feminists rules .
This makes it hard , because if they do n't , they are looked down upon by their piers .
An example is military women wanting to serve in combat positions when at war .
Feminists argued this a lot when the Iraq war was going on .
They felt that women should have been given the chance to fight .
I felt that these people were crazy .
Women just ca n't fight in a war very well .
The are not strong enough and if captured could be raped .
They feel that it is not fair that men are the only ones .
Other women , though , are glad that the rule in the United States stands as it does .
Feminists have talked about promotions in the work place as not being fair .
Also sexual harassment is involved in a lot of suits .
Many women believe that they are the victims .
I agree that five to ten years ago this might have been true , but now many employers are the victims .
They are scared of what a woman can do and sometimes women get looked at differently .
There are some things that women can do better than men and there are some things that men can do better than women .
God would have created us all the same if this was not true .
Feminists are trying to make everyone equal and that is impossible to do because nature can not be changed .
More and more office jobs are being filled by the woman but a lot of the physical jobs are still filled by men .
I think that the traditional roles were a good thing , but the modernization has changed everyone 's habits .
Divorce is at fifty percent and rising , women are having more heart attacks , being more stressful , and kids are being more neglected .
Modernization is good , but I think that women should not be pressured into this if this is not for them .
There will be a woman in the presidency , and running a lot more companies .
Women should be created equal , but they can only do what nature intended they to do ...
Whenever a movement is began whether it be political , religious , or artistic , stereotypes are quick to form .
People normally associated with politics , religion , or art are quickly lumped into categories regardless of individual differences .
This tragedy is worsened by the tendency of those outside the movement to remember the radical and ignore the common or ordinary .
This is especially true of the Women 's Liberation Movement in America .
Since its beginnings in the late nineteenth century , Women 's Liberation has been met with adamant , and often obstinate oppostion .
Some of the first radicals , Susan B. Anthony and George Sand ( although French ) were noticed and ridiculed , thus defeating their cause , because of their aggressive action .
At the same time other feminists such as Emily Dickinson were virtually ignored during their lifetime and only acknowledged posthumously as being part of the movement .
This ignorance of other less aggressive feminists , made it seem as though the feminist movement was headed only by wild , disgruntled zealots and was therfore , detrimental to the good of society .
Although " radicals " such as Sand and Anthony seem docile and backward in modern standards , the problem still exists .
From the very beginning the Women 's Movement in America has been fighting a losing battle .
However , I contend that the fault does not lie with the radical members of the movement , but rather , in the perception of those observing the movement .
When Women 's Lib really took off again in the late 1960s , it was again destined for failure .
Immediately , the focus was on radicals like Stein , instead of the housewife who returned to college and made a career for herself .
Those outside the movement could only see the differences between " normality " and Women 's Lib .
This is still true twenty - five years later .
Women supporting equal pay for women and and other " liberal " causes like affirmative action are only seen in the shadow of the bra - burning , anti - shaving leaders of the 1970s .
The good of their cause is undermined by the perception of the radicals .
So what am I getting at ?
Only that so - called feminists have not in and of themselves harmed the Women 's movement .
However , the popular perception of them has .
For so many years the good that feminists have promote for women has fallen by the wayside in lieu of other more interesting , i.e. radical ideas .
Like many other aspects and movements in life , they would be more readiliy received if the public it was being aimed was not so jaded .
Within this century there have been many technological advances which have resulted in a drastically different society than that of a hundred years ago .
Clearly , of the inventions of this century , the one that has made the most impact on world views and lifestyle is the television .
This instrument has brought other worlds right into the living room , making it possible to see life in other countries in a way that was never before possible .
However , the invention of television also gave society an easy way to waste time ; one has only to turn it on to tune out reality .
Television has potential to offer wonderful things to its viewers , such as educational programming for children , cultural programs about far away places , and a closer look at current events than can not be given by newspaper .
Television has the power to bring war into the home as well as artistic expressions of those involved in the program production , giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture more fully .
However , this is not the way in which television has influenced society .
On the contrary , television has become the escape route of the masses , a way for people to flee from the conflicts they experience in their culture , rather than confront them and try to understand them .
In the minds of most Americans , television is regarded as a diversion rather than an educational tool , as free entertainment instead of easily accessible knowledge .
Millions of Americans can be found to be staring at the T.V. at any one time , watching sit - coms , soap - operas , and cartoons .
The T.V. has become the center of many households ; in many families , the only time that everyone is together is when they are watching television .
T.V. is a major cause of lack of togetherness found in many American families , and has also resulted in an increase in laziness .
The more time one spends watching TV , the less motivated he becomes ; there is no need to seek worthwhile activities when it is much easier to sit on the couch , pick up the remote control , and stare at a box .
Television , therefore , has changed society in ways that could hardly have been dreamed of 00 years ago .
It has given society another creative vein , a look at worlds which could be seen in no other way , and an opportunity to better educate itself .
However , throughout the years , television has lost much of its integrety ; the programs offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education .
The entertainment aspect of television has offered society an easy escape from its problems and dificulties .
Therefore , since the invention of television , society has becomed more informed but too lazy to think about this new information , and has distanced itself from family life .
A discovery that has significantly changed many peoples lives and their ways of thinking is the epidemic , known as AIDS .
Though it has probably been around for awhile , it 's presence hasn't really been known untill fairly recently , and it 's consequences have been devistating .
AIDS has definately had an impact on people in the United States and probably all over the world because it always leads to death and there is no cure .
It has caused a lot of prejudice and paranoia among people which has torn them apart .
For example , there is more of stigma attached to being a homosexual male , not only because of their sexual preference , but they probably have AIDS too .
This kind of ignorant thinking is breaking us apart .
Also , when Ryan White , a boy who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion was diagnosed , the people of his town and his school treated him like a complete outcast and would n't allow him to attend school .
With new discoveries of AIDS , paranoia is at an all time high .
Doctors are discovering that some undetectable strands of AIDS do exist .
This has really scared people because they may have AIDS and not even know it .
I feel this has really made people think about their actions .
In the early eighties " casual sex " in the United States was a widely accepted idea , now it is something people really take into consideration and rarely occurs .
Relationships seemed to be valued more than one night stands .
People are starting to realize that they really do have to be careful , and with more education on this disease , I 'm sure more changes will come about .
The twentieth century has seen more wars than any other previous bloc of time .
Though advances in communication , transportation , and information sharing , the world as a body of people living in close proximity , has rapidly shrunk .
In the second of the world wars , the race was on to create the most devastating , most powerful , and most frightening weapon our people had ever known .
In my opinion , the discovery and harness of atom and its energy and the corresponding invention of nuclear weapons have been the most significant factors of change in our lifetime , if not , perhaps , in several lifetimes .
As missile technology and nuclear fusion capacities increased and improved , fear began to replace nationalism , and our small world erected barriers between its members .
From my experience as an American , I can remember associating communism with nuclear threat , Soviet citizens with anti - Christ , and bomb shelters , secret cities for underground , and weapons orbiting our planet , with daily , normal life .
Perhaps this increasingly common mentality is the worst effect of our nuclear , cold war age .
In a planet which desperately needs our focus on environmental and humanitarian issues , my country has spent uncountable trillions of dollars on nuclear weapons testing , improvement , and implementation .
As a commonplace goal and testimonial landmark to 9 presidential administrations , the cold war has manifested its awesome power and control over nearly every facet of Americana ; from survival kits and basement bombshelters to an ever circulating cheif Executive commandpost from the air .
In just the past three years our family of nations has seen the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and hundreds of other smaller symbols of freedom , and an end to oppression in many circumstances .
With this , the walls , barbed wire , and mental barriers are falling , bringing more change than our planet has seen since its genesis .
Although the old habits die hard , they are indeed dying .
In America the military has been reduced by several thousand troops , and the production of nuclear warheads has virtually arrived a standstill .
Hopefully , with continued efforts , our use of nuclear fusion and fission will turn from mediums of strategy , destruction , and waste to matters of energy production , medicine , and other humanitarian goals .
With this thawing of attitudes , our frigid planet and cold neighbors may once again be a warm and friendly people .
The discovery of penicillin as an antibiotic was one of the greatest advances in medicinal chemistry .
As a natural antibiotic , penicillin was discovered to have many uses in stopping and preventing the spread of infections .
This " wonder - drug " also led to the discovery of a variety of other naturally - occurring antibiotics that could also be cultured " in vitro " in a laboratory .
This sudden burst of useful compounds not only improved the chances of a patient 's survival in a hospital but also caused a great need for medical chemists to study and classify each new drug as it was discovered .
As discoveries of new antibiotics decreased , chemists began to wonder if certain variations of these drugs could be synthesized and also used as medicine .
It was also attemped to increase the production of the naturally - occurring antibiotics through synthesis .
Both of these new attempts caused a need for more research , more companies , and more medical chemists , and the industry increased tremendously .
It was discovered that the older drugs could be synthesized efficiently while still remaining biologically active .
New drugs were also synthesized ; some were found to be medically useful while others were not .
A variety of new drugs continuously appeared on the market and changed the way people thought about taking medicine .
It was now much easier to obtain antibiotics for simple illnesses , such as the common cold .
Huge enterprises , such as Upjohn , were formed and grew , and universities had research teams devoted to producing efficient synthesis routes for the production of all kinds of antibiotics .
The discovery of one compound led to the increase of health of millions of people , to the discovery of more and more antibiotics , and to a booming industry comprised of research teams and large companies .
The synthesis of antibiotics and research of their uses still continues today as thousands of universities and companies around the world continue the work of a small bacteria -- the producer of penicillin .
The modern microcomputer ( PC ) has evolved at an incredibly fast pace : from the very first modern computer in the 1940 's to the computers of today , there have been many technological advances and also there has been a tremendous impact on society .
The computer has eliminated many jobs through automation of factories ; accounting , engineering , and other scientific programs , etc .
The effects of the computer have been tremendous ; however , the phenomenon is a catch-22 .
The computer has made life easier from a physical standpoint and harder from a mental standpoint .
The physical effects of the computer are numerous and easily seen .
In offices , the computer is everywhere .
From word processors to spreadsheet / database programs , computers have made office work easier and faster .
Automation of factories has also eliminated many manual jobs .
Also almost everyone has at least one simple computer , e.g. a calculator .
There are of course many other things computers are used for , but a lengthy list is not necessary as everyone already knows ( except for people in 2nd and 3rd world countries ) how abundant computers are .
The mental effect of computers is two - fold .
Firstly , computers have made mathematical computations so easy to do , many people do not fully understand how or why their computer works .
This has created a surplus of " needless " computations , figures , etc .
People can easily do calculus or other type functions with a computer .
What many people do not realize is that computers make errors all the time .
Granted , it is the person who " told " the computer what to do that truly made the error ; however if that person knew what he should do , or better stated " was able to do with a computer " , he would not have erroneous answers .
Mathematical models , theories , etc .
are absolutely riddled with errors simply because there are many things people do n't know or ca n't predict .
Due to this errors frequently exist in the world of computers simply because humans are ignorant- for whatever reason - of many " variables " .
Secondly , computers have sometimes become more reliable than people .
A computer 's circuits do n't get tired and , if programmed 100% correctly ( another perhaps impossible computation ) , never make errors .
This supposed reliability has left many workers out of work .
The effects of this are unpredictable .
Anger , frustration , fear , and many other negative feelings have sprung up simultaneously with the rise of computer usage .
Clearly , there is evidence of good and bad results from the advent of the modern computer .
It would be practically impossible to throw the computer away or never use it again .
Yet there are practical solutions .
Better mathematical education is needed for everyone who uses a computer other than a simple calculator .
Also , curtailing some theoretical programming could eliminate alarming predictions or erroneous results .
The key is probably in the classroom .
People should learn more about the ramifications about what they are doing .
( This probably would require understanding of philosophy and psychology as well as mathematics and science . )
In either case , if computers are good or bad , it would be difficult to dispute their impact on people 's lives .
A large , 1/2 egg , sometimes as large as a small FIAT , with a metal arrow in it 's center has changed the size of the world , and communication amongst the countries within it .
The satellite dish , created in the last 0 years , has changed the meaning of telecommunication .
In part , it has created The Information Age , as the latter part of the 20th ctry , is often labelled .
Not certain about the date of its invention , it must be recognized as one of the more vital tools used in society today , amongst world leaders , trading companies , and the media , as well as the entertainment world .
Ted Turner revolutionized the use of the satellite , with his creation of CNN , the round - the - clock , round - the - world news station .
Presidents and dictators alike switch the channel to recieve first hand information from the network , such as impeachments , coup d'etats or civil wars .
Decisions , of governmental autonomy , are being made , based on that nights news CNN commentator .
The leaders and presidents of enterprises such as panasonic and CORE refer to CNN , created by satellite dish , on a daily bases .
Stocks are an integral part of their livelihood .
The entertainment world has taken full advantage of the satellite dish , subtitling the Information Age , with the MTV age .
The creation of MTV in 1980 , has dramatically changed the entertainment business .
The money poured into creating videos , and the profits from viewership- have had a strong affect on the world economy .
40% of U.S. millionares are entertainers .
The Satellite dish has also created distinct advantages for Cable TV and naval programs as well .
The intelligence of an average teenager is lowering itself due to cable viewing , created by the satellite dish .
Naval programs have wasted exceeding amounts of money in the United States , due to the satellite dish .
And one must not forget space programs such a STARWARS .
The creation of the satellite dish in the past 20 years , has altered the average intelligence of the human being for the better and sometimes worse .
It has created an information age , which could be dangerous , and heightened an entertainer 's salary .
The pro 's and con 's of the satellite dish are numerous .
The only observation which can be made , is that : It has altered people lives significantly .
It is up to the average person to decide if this alteration will be for the better or worse .
The discovery of the Atomic energy , is undoubtedly the the most awesome as well as terrible invention not only of the 20th century but of all time .
In 1945 , J. Robert Oppenheimer unveiled to the world his invention in the form that is still most familiar to us today : The Atomic bomb .
The reason behind the fear that this energy causes is routed in its incredible power to destroy .
Never before had the world seen something with such a capacity to kill .
Never before had one object of such small size been able to take so many lives .
For this reason , It is considered the most awe - inspiring and dangerous weapon in the world .
Unfortunately , with each progressive day , the world 's need for this dangerous energy augments .
For not only does it have the capacity to kill ,
but also the capability to supply and energize the world .
The drawback is the danger .
In utilizing this power in plants and factories we run the risk of contaminating our land , blowing holes in our sky , rendering our seas useless , and killing our species as well as all the species of the earth .
Although we have many other power source alternatives , we still continue to use this dangerous invention .
It is illogical to think that with continued nuclear use , we can escape harm .
Already as a result of pollution and other various factors , we have holes in our ozone layer and problems with our soil in many parts of the world .
It would be logical to think that the leaders of the world would confer and aspire to put a stop to nuclear use in an effort to avoid any further damage to the earth and its inhabitants .
The saddest part of this tragedy is that there have been very few efforts to do so .
The lack of sight from our leaders is almost appalling .
With the lack of respect for the planet that is the general attitude of today , what is to become of our children .
The current situation of the world 's environment is a sad one .
It is also however , a problem of which nuclear energy is only a small piece .
Unfortunately , the day will soon come when the damage caused by this apathy will be irreversable .
This is why it is imperative to act today .
It starts with you .
Write your local congressman .
An invention of the 20th century which I think has significantly changed people 's lives is the invention of the airplane .
The extend to which this invention has altered people 's lives is astronomical .
The airplane opened doors to traveling and also broadened people 's perceptions of the entire world .
It also introduced what seemed a completely impossible concept which no human is capable of doing without a machine : the concept of flying .
Before the invention of the airplane , long distance traveling was a very difficult , time consuming task .
For this reason people did not travel extremely long distances and missed the opportunity of visiting countries with cultures very different from their own .
One could travel by boat but this was inconvenient and often dangerous because of various things like disease , hunger , and threatening weather ; also as noted above , it was extremely time consuming .
Because of the lack of long distance travel people often had a very ethnocentric and limited concept of the world .
I have learned a lot about my own culture just from being in Spain and that is the only foreign country I have ever visited .
I can admit that before I came to Spain I was very ignorant about other cultures .
Even though I would watch the news and read about other cultures I still did not have the opportunity to witness it first hand .
The invention of the airplane has opened many doors and one other door is international relations .
Since the invention of the airplane the world has increased close contact between political systems , and international business endeavors .
The frequency that which foreign countries are able to communicate and negotiate face to face has improved drastically the establishment of international trade .
The airplane has also basically speeded up the whole postal communication system also .
Life with airplanes is more rapid paced .
Cars , telephones , and nuclear energy are just three examples of inventions and discoveries that have had profound effects on modern day life .
We must remember , however , that the field of technology is not the only one in which significant advances have been made in the 0th century .
Another " discovery " of this past century has been feminism , which has had a significant impact on the lives of both men and women .
Of course , the issue of feminism is not a new one , but it is just within the past century that much progress has been made towards the equality of women ( with the important exception of women winning the right to vote in the 1800s ) .
As recently as the 1950s , it was still the most typical as well as the ideal to have the woman in the home , housekeeping and tending the children .
The first significant equal rights movement in the U.S. was in the 70s with the Equal Rights Amendment , which failed .
Even today , the woman is still only earning something like 60 cents for every dollar that a man earns .
Feminism does not only have to do with work and money , but also with the image of women .
It 's only recently that we 've " discovered " , or begun to think about rather , how much things as varying as pornography or the language we use helps to form the image of women .
A recognition of such influences on the image of women is the first step in breaking it down , so that women are seen for who they truly are .
Feminism is better described as a " discovery in progress " ; it 's a movement , an attitude that has not yet become mainstream .
Only when women have achieved equality with men , will there cease to be a need for feminism , and the discovery will have been completed .
The idea I feel that has most significantly changed people 's lives in the 20th century is that of caring for the environment .
Today , people have become aware of the importance of environment to our future .
People are concerned with nuclear weapons .
We realize that countries that which have many weapons have the power to destroy the world .
Also related to this topic is nuclear waste .
Nuclear waste is not only harmful to humans ; it also kills animals and plants .
We are now fighting for acts to clean up our lakes and rivers .
Companies are no longer able to freely dump their wastes w / o being heavily fined .
People have also become concerned with nature .
We used to assume our natural resources were never ending .
Now , though , we realize what we use , needs to be replaced .
For example deforestation is a very big issue , many groups have formed to plant more trees .
We also realize our fossil fuels need to be used more conservatively .
Another important topic we are all aware of is recycling .
This links 2 issues , one of not producing much nonbiodegradable products and the other of reusing what we have .
( Recycling in a small way also helps those w / o homes b / c they receive money for their collections ) .
Many countries realize that recycling is not only beneficial to their economy it also is beneficial to their environment .
Another important issue is that of conserving energy .
In the past , once again , we assumed our energy was never ending .
Now though people are more inclined to turn off their lights when they 're not in their rooms , to not leave taps running and basically not to waste our natural resources .
We realize that conserving is not beneficial to our environment but it is also saves money .
We have also become more considerable of our animal life .
We are no longer able to kill animals freely .
We do still raise some for food but hunting is limited and we are all aware of the possibilities of extinction .
One realizes that animals have rights too .
In conclusion , the idea of caring for the environment is still a new one .
We are slowly becoming more aware and are beginning to take more precautions .
The ideas above are just a few of the topics we are now concerned with .
But we are heading in the right direction and hopeful by the 21st century we will have fixed everything we have destroyed !
Computers have definitely effected peoples lives .
I have a computer and my life has change because of it .
I 'm able to store almost all the information I need for school and for other things in my computer whereas before I had a computer my desk was cluttered w/ paper and records of all sorts , I no longer need to keep these records but only to transfer them to my computer .
This means I 'm able to store more information in an organized fashion .
Though I have only used a fraction of my computer 's ability , I 'm still aware of the tremendous opportunities which I have or will have .
Aside from being able to store great amounts of info , I 'm also able to process and to edit things quickly .
For example , without the use of a computer I had to balance my checkbook once a month and had to this w/ a calculator , a pen and a piece of paper .
Of course , this was very time consuming and open to error . W/ the use of a computer I have programmed the computer to make the calculations which I once had to make .
Also , w/ the use of the Word Processor I 'm able to edit and rearrange documents w / out altering the entire document , and furthermore , though I have yet to use the Communications program in my computer , this program seems to be extraordinarily helpful .
My father has the same program in his computer and is able to buy on line tickets w / out leaving the house and moreover w / out picking up the phone .
Also , I realize that my experience w/ computers is limited and that the power of computers , for me , is incomprehensible .
I 'm now here in Madrid .
How did I get there ?
Well , I applied to the this program , was accepted , and flew here form the US .
But , w / out the use of computers I would still be struggling w/ the secretary in the International Programs Office at Boston University , no doubt .
Instead , once I applied to the program- the application for which was probably computer generated- I assume my info was processed by a computer .
W / out this luxury , the International Programs Office would inevitably inundated w/ paperwork and things would therefore be lost or at least misplaced .
When booking my flight , though I did not do this myself , the transaction would seem impossible minus the aid of computers .
Computers have had a most significant impact on the people in the latter 1/2 of the 20th century .
An invention of the 20th century that I think has significantly changed people 's lives is television .
TV allows the instantaneous communication of ideas , images , news , etc .
Now , if something is happening in any part of the world- from across town all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world can watch this event as it is happening .
While previously people had to wait days , or even weeks for news ( which consisted of second - or third - hand accounts , which always involved much interpretation and distortion ) now they can see it happening , for themselves , as it is happening , this allows them to make their own , informed judgment about the event ; and if a reaction is necessary- such as the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be made immediately , while the emotions are still strong , and before the action is finalized .
As well , the fact that so many people ( especially in the US ) have television sets means that everybody ( well , at least everybody who watches ) receives the same inflow of information and ideas .
So , for example , people in Spain can be informed about how people in California or Japan speak and act , this allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas .
In my opinion , this is one part of the process of making the world a " smaller " , more unified place , or a " global village " as one journalist has called this world of the Information Age .
Not only the news , but also entertainment is an important practical function of television , through television entertainment , as through literature and drama , people learn different messages about life .
They can see various actions acted out to their ends , and understand the consequences of these actions , without having to perform the same actions and experience the consequences for themselves .
Unfortunately these TV shows are not always accurate portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence , as well as making life seem the good guy always wins , and always lives thru dangerous situations .
However , this sense of reality is not so distorted , and so hidden that people are going around acting like Superman .
As long as one has a well - developed sense of reality , TV can be an excellent tool for understanding the world we live in .
The waters of the culunary seas have been calm and consistant for centuries .
Progress has move slow like the tides and the constant rythm of the waves have showed little changed .
However with the daybreak of the twentyth century a storm has brewed .
With this storm the waters have churned and spawned a wave that has crashed upon the rocks of every kitchen .
This wave is the microwave .
Never before has such an invention revolutionized a science like this .
At the dawn of time , cave men cooked animal flesh over open fires .
As History progressed , spits and barbeques emerged .
Technology saw the advent of the wood stove , and later ones fueled by coal .
Modern times saw gas and electric ranges as to staple .
All these things had one thing in common : FIRE .
Flame , the source of life , always used to prepare the fool of mankind throughout History .
However , the microwave uses radiation to excite water particles in food , thus creating friction , which creates heat .
This is a prime example of thinking that does not follow in old footsteps but breaks away from convention and forges new routes .
If this were not amazing enough , the microwave cuts cooking time in half .
If you had told someone 100 yrs ago that you could cut cooking time in half , and not use fire , they would have thought you crazy , or bewitched , or under the influence of heavy drugs .
In an age where time is the scarcest comodity , our society has embraced this eliminator of wasted hours in the kitchen .
A mother who works , can come home can whip up something in minutes in the microwave , whereas before she would have been slaving in the kitchen .
The microwave is excellent for re - heating making it easier for people to make excess food to be eaten later .
Again time is conserved -- Children are able to use this simple device without parental fear of fires starting .
For As I have said before , there is no fire !
This marvel of technology has helped propel people into the dizzing pace of life that most of us lead in the 20th century .
Throughout History one can see that great revelations in all areas come from breaks in tradition , new insights , and differents perspectives .
All these were needed to create the microwave which is essential nowadays .
Eating is something everyone must do .
This device has sped up one of our most important activities and thus revolutionized life in the fast paced 20th century .
When I was in tenth grade a teacher said that the 2 most important inventions that made possible the idea of a repressive government were the machine gun and the radio .
A machine gun can be used to keep civil peace , enforce Marshall Law .
The radio can be used to communicate ideas and under a dictatorship , propaganda .
In the 20th Century the machine gun has not changed all that many lives ( except for those that it ' s killed ) , but the invention of radio has made a tremendous impact .
The idea behind the radio is simple .
There is one transmitter and it sends its signals through the air , waves , with potential for millions of receivers .
In the 20th Century radio has become a source of information and entertainment .
Radio keeps people informed .
I don ' t think any people of my generation can even comprehend now our lives would be different .
Every morning I listen for the weather forcast and dress accordingly .
At night one can sit by the radio and hear how the events of the day unfolded .
Radio , hence , gives people the option of becoming passive observers rather than active participants in the news making process .
Newspapers had been around for many years but it was not until the invention of radio that the power of the media became evident .
Radio gives the ability to reach many more people , instantly .
As a form of entertainment , radio and its most important and now more common offshoot , television , has changed people 's lives .
A typical day for a child in today 's world , consists of going to school and coming home to watch T.V.
There have even been forms of entertainment , for example videogames , made for this other form of entertainment .
Nowadays everybody watches T.V.
My señora , for example , is over 100 years old , and for her T.V. is the greatest thing in the world .
She sits in front of it all day and it keeps her happy .
Television offers soap operas , game shows , sit - coms , sporting events , movies and much more to keep us entertained 24 hours a day .
In short , I don ' t know what life was like before radio , but its invention has changed the way we see and do things .
A current ideology in the United States today is for one to be successful , one must follow all of the written and unwritten rules of society ,
everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and when one does not do this one fails .
One can see these ideas in popular media everyday .
T.V. comercials and T.V. programs project models of how one should be .
In the 20th cen , the values of / that the United States was founded on have changed in meaning and sense when applied to modern day America , nothing was ever equal .
And today , since the invention and utilization of modern technologies such as computers life for americans moves at a much faster pace .
People are more mobile , can work more , and buy more things , but time for relaxation and family are often substitued with T.V. In America , this growing individualistic society , one nolonger sees the realitive humanness between people , instead one sees the differences , the unlucky , the unsuccessfull , and attribute thier inadequacy to achieve to a lack of effort .
With everyone moving at such a fast pace , the gaps are easy to miss , the voices of the mass media easily replace those voices that struggle to be heard .
The parts of the new machine that need oiled and regulated .
When Voltaire wrote Candide , a literary style known as Neoclassicism was at its peak .
There was a group of scholars in France , l'Academie Français , that set guidelines for French literature .
According to l'Academie Français , all literature of the Neoclassic period must follow the rules of propriety which regulated the author should avoid certain topics , including sex , violence , church , and state issues .
Another standard upheld by the Academie is the idea of verisimilitude , making literature as realistic as possible by keeping the time , setting and plot true to life .
Voltaire , as a Neoclassicist , knew all these regulations and followed them in his literature .
However , when writing Candide , Voltaire defied the Academie 's rules .
Candide is a parody on the guidelines of Neoclassicism .
Neoclassicists liked for literature to have good manners : they did not want to step on anyone 's toes by mentioning sex , violence , church , or state issues .
In Candide Voltaire did not seem to mind stepping on toes - in fact , he did not mind smashing feet !
Voltaire went beyond the comfort level when he mentioned sex .
He told of the two girls of Orellion who were lovers of monkeys , and of the Baron who bathed with the Musselman and was punished for his homosexual act .
Sex turned into violence when Cunegonde was being raped by a Barber , and witnessed his murder while he was on top of her .
The wise old woman underwent the removal of a buttock by pirates , as well as experiencing rape .
After the Baron is caught bathing with the Mussalman , he receives 100 lashes for his sin .
Candide stabs the Baron , a Jesuit Priest , after the Baron forbids Candides marriage to Cunegonde .
Ironically , although Voltaire mentions many acts of violence , each act is treated lightly : Cunegonde and the old woman both tell their tales of being defiled like an entertaining story in their conversations about their travels ; the Baron also continues his tale with style after telling of his beating ; and after Candide " kills " the Baron , he leaves to search for Cunegonde with no second thought until he reencounters the Baron later in his travels .
The light attitude in which these acts of sex and violence are written shows the parody form in which Voltaire writes Candide .
Voltaire chooses not to stay away from the church and state issues .
He attracts the hippocracy of the Church in the old woman 's father being the Pope .
When Candide visits the land of Eldorado , Voltaire shows the people 's perfect relationship to God : they only praise God because there is nothing they want from God .
Voltaire uses this perfect relationship to God in an unrealistic situation to foil society 's imperfect relationship with God in the real world .
Voltaire makes fun of aristocracy in his description of the Baron , who came from 71 generations of nobility but still lacks gentilesse .
According the Lunde , 35% of homicide victims are killed by someone they know .
Statistics from 56 are greater than Lundes ' thesis .
Frustration is the main factor most implicated in these tragedies .
Most cases are those of the " trigger puling the finger " .
Today , racial prejudice still exists , but less action has taken place than 30 years ago .
Thirty years ago , minorities could n't ride a bus , vote , or go to school with white people .
Desegragation reduced some prejudice , but it still exists .
The difference is , today social prejudice is not openly expressed as it was 30 years ago .
I would tell the client to be extremely nice to that person and do favors for that person .
That person would then feel obligated to do nice things back and return favors .
This is based on eauity theory .
It would be better for the client to do nice things for the person that it would be to ask a favor of the person .
Someone who live in the north who comes to live in the south may not be prejudice toward Blacks at first .
After living in the south for a while , they may adopt southern attitudes toward Blacks and feel prejudice toward them .
This is conformity .
The same goes for Southerners who move north .
They come to feel prejudice toward Jews .
I know someone who has lived all over the world .
He is prejudice toward Jews , Blacks , and Mexicans .
He adopted white attitudes against minorities in the different regions he has lived in .
Our country has been coined a " melting - pot " inferring that we all come from different that we all come from different background but have joined or melted together to produce homogeneous Americans .
But a persons heritage , as we are realizing , is important to their sense of self and community .
Ethnic American cultures have been reviving and trying to reestablish roots that were once lopped off to a model U.S. citizen .
The differences they are rediscovering only add more color , flavor and excitement to that brewing " pot " of our people .
However , some individuals and even groups of Americans are reacting negatively to this ethnic explosion ( seen most clearly through the arts ) .
They do n't want to accept these differences .
They choose to remain indifferent to the plights of their fellow Americans .
As Ellie Weisel , author of such books as Night says about indifference : it is the opposite of everything good .
The opposite of love , beauty , intelligence , light , joy , life and growth are not their familiar ontonyms but indifference .
Ethnic American literature tries to fight this indifference by vividly and uniquely expressing certain aspects of different American culture .
The gamut of ethnic American literature is without bounds .
Each group has its own peculiarities and attributes that make it 's writing unique .
In many cases the words used in ethnic American literature reflect a knowledge of a different " mother tongue " .
For instance , Native Americans poetry is more expressive and visual partly because their language is deeply rooted in the observation of the natural environment .
Chinese American Literature is philisophical / literal because their native language is so .
African American literature is often melodious and rhythmic mirroring their similar achievements in Jazzy and Blues music .
All these examples ( and more ) give us some insight to other cultures we would otherwise never know .
The stories told in this genre of literature , however , are likely the most important aspect of Ethnic American literature .
It is through the experiences of the characters that we learn about the different cultures in the United States .
When we learn of the trials and hardships that they went through we can sympethize with their emotions and try to accept that diversity .
The stories of black American slaves and of concentration camp victems are necessary to avoid indifference .
Without learning about the past ( and present ) horrors there is no way to ensure future humanity .
Ethnic American literature benefits U.S. citizens in many ways .
It opens our eyes to the reality of the suffering of others .
It gives us a fresh and new perspective on the world around us .
It helps us to understand our personal relationships better .
Most of all , it gives us more common ground on which to live , and grow , and prosper .
Hopefully we will someday fulfill Elie Weisel 's goal and end indifference ; this literature is a step in the right direction towards acceptance in the diversity of our country .
Different is beautiful !
Violence on television can be seen throughout the many channels that cable has to offer .
With an average national TV viewing time of 7 1/4 hours daily , the prevalence of violence in broadcasts is a serious concern .
Television programming in the United States is considered the most violent in advanced industrialized nations ( Hepburn 1 ) .
Many children watch violent tv shows because the action thrills them and can sometimes cause the child to become violent .
Violence is common in TV entertainment-- the dramas that portray stories about crime , psychotic murderers , police cases , emergency services , international terrorism , and war ( Hepburn 1 ) .
Television violence is prevalent in the United States and some people disagree with its effects on children .
The V - chip is an electrical device that blocks out violent television shows .
Some people , such as the Senate Commerce Committee , are not satisfied with it .
The Senate Commerce Committee approved bills creating a partial ban on TV violence and a so - called report card that would identify stations carrying violent programming and the advertisers sponsoring it .
The bills would apply to broadcasting and cable ( Stern 1 ) .
Some of the proposals to antiviolence are as follows : the Senate V - chip , the House V - chip , a Technology Fund , a Violence Safe Harbor , and a Violence Report Card .
These proposals could work if Congress had some support .
The National Association of Broadcasters accused the Senate of " piling on a stream of proposals to build up an unprecedented federal censorship bureaucracy " .
The NAB also insisted that broadcasters already have responded to concerns over violence on television ( Stern 1 ) .
Some television shows show violence because it appeals to adult viewers .
If a certain plot involves a murder , then the murder must happen .
Some people may not want the actual murder to be shown , but that is up to whomever is writing the television show .
Many made for television movies say that it may contain violent scenes and that viewer discretion is advised , but how many parents actually watch television with their teenager ?
An exhaustive examination of the broadcast networks ' programming during the 1995 - 1995 season has concluded that sinister combat violence ' pervades a significant number of Saturday - morning cartoons ( Jensen 1 ) .
How much violence is there ?
The most violent cartoons are ' Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ' , ' Spider Man ' , and some ' Bugs Bunny ' episodes with Elmer Fudd .
As for the shows containing sinister combat violence , well that is strictly up to the viewer to decide .
The cause for television violence is to add texture to the show and not to poison children 's minds .
The infamous V - chip may stop some shows from being shown to children , but one day that child will see violence and they will have to deal with it , rationally or not .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am sad to read about Richard not being at his best .
I hope that he will recover soon and that he will make it to our conference .
As far as organisation is concerned , adequate number of double rooms with shower or bath have been booked for your group at the Palace hotel located across the main street from the train station .
To come to our college , you can either watch downhill to the lake front ( about 10 min ) or take the new cable car from the train station .
The college is just stairs away from the bottom end .
The end - of - conference party will take place on a boat cruising on the lake .
It will start by a speech from the Director of the conference , followed by a meal .
The recreative part will begin at 10 pm with a short musical comedy performed by some of our students and end with fireworks launched from the roof of the college at 2 am .
As nights may be cold at this time of the year , may I suggest that you take with you a pullover .
Appart of that , there is no recommendation as to what to wear .
Depending on the interests of your students , I would suggest that you visit the internet site of the tourist office : www.neuchatel.ch .
yours sincerely
Where are you ?
is very often the first question that you will be asked when answering the phone .
Why ?
Because somebody has invented the most popular communication device ever .
The mobile phone .
Once heavy , expensive and not reliable , the new mobile phone fits in almost any pocket and is given away by the operator to attract new customers .
Due to the mobile phone .
communication has changed , not improved .
Of course it allows to be reached everywhere ( even in places you would n't want . )
For rescue teams , it is a great help .
But is n't it a handicap outside professional life .
Should n't people communicate with those they are next to instead of calling someone 2 miles away .
It is not rare to see two people walking side by side , both talking on the phone .
Would n't it be better to prepare the shopping list instead of dialing home to ask which salad to buy .
Mobile phone is a marvellous invention but as for cigarettes , we should right on it
CAUTION : use of this device may damage your brain .
Dear Mrs Smith
I am writing to reply your letter you wrote me on 10 June .
Firstly , I would like to tell you , that the group has been booked into Palace Hotel , which locates beside the congress house in the centre .
You can make contact with Mrs Brackenbury using the number 06 8793888 .
Secondly , the best way from the hotel to the conference is to take the bus , which is specially organized by us .
The bus leaves at 8:00 every morning and gets back to the hotel at 6 o'clock in the evening .
Off course there 's also a bus number 8 in front of the hotel is also suitable , but it leaves only every half an hour .
The end - of - conference party , which happens in the evening on 20 June , is going to be held on the coast .
Beside the barbecue , there are some well - known student bands from our country are performing music through the whole night .
What 's more is , that there 's a Latin music band coming to make the party more colourful .
It plays from 10:00 to 11:00 , while the students can enjoy it with dancing .
The main events of the party will end up at about 12:30 in the night .
As you see , what to wear is just something casual .
Finally , in the last afternoon , we could visit the museums , markets ( we have a very interesting robot - market ) .
Basically it 's a free time for the students to look round here by themselves .
I hope your questions re answered appropriatly .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you on the conference .
Yours sincerely ,
Computer Life
Now - a - day computer can be found in almost every corner , in offices , in shops .
Or even in cars and washmachines there 're computer chips .
What has computer affected to our life ?
First of all , the efficiency of the society has been improved .
When shopping , we do n't need to wait the Kasse to take every article 's note by hand .
When booking a airline , we can just simply make a phone to any agency , and get it done in one minute .
Secondly , instead of looking up tons of books to get the information what we need , we can very easily search it from internet or on the local network .
It 's a very often heard , that someone , who has a special illness , gets operations by a foreign institutes , which he find via internet .
Moreover , with computer network , it can be possible that people work from home , making projects , controling operations or having conferences .
Lastly the way of communications has been also changed .
Instead of the tranditional telecommunication , we can talk , mail or even see each other with the help of computer network .
Of course there 're also some aspects in which the computer technology need to be improved .
For example , reading on the screen is still not as comfortable as on papers .
A very important and severe problem is the reliability and security .
Till now , to completely rely on computer is still somehow not safe enough .
In conclusion , computer have become a very essential necessity of our life , and it 's still a young invention , which need to be improved .
Dear Maria
First at all , I am sorry about Richard illness .
Please remember me to him and give him my best wishes .
About your request , I 'm going to give you all the information that I think you must need , however you can call me if you consider it necessary , ( my phone number is 2496 9731 ) .
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel .
Because it is a wellkown hotel it should be easy to find it .
Moreover , it is really well - located so it will allow you to move around the city without any problem .
Even more the conference is going to take place in the Exhibition Centre , which is located only five minutes walking far from the Hotel .
We haven't asked for any special clothes so I would wear casual and comfortable clothes , although you can come well - dressed , if you feel better .
After the conference we are going to have an informal dinner with a previous snack time in order to introduce each others .
Finally in my opinion , you should visit the Art Gallery .
It will take you two or three hours but it 's a gorgeous place .
I look forward hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
" Sagrada Familia " a real holly building .
If you are looking for a special building in Barcelona , which you can like whatever your tastes are , you should visit the " Sagrada Familia " .
Among the big number of choices , this unfinished church offers a gorgeous view fro the top of its towers , a charming story and one of the most representative examples of the Catalonia modernisme art .
Gaudi conceived this church n 1912 , though it was n't until 1920 they started to build it .
Since the beginning the work was interrupted in different periods and started again .
After Gaudi death it was critical stop which was fortunately solved three years later .
Nowadays , a hard work is being done in order to finish as soon as possible .
The visitor can wonder around all the building or follow a guided visit .
There is a exhibition room where maps and projects can be consulted .
And , unless you suffer from your heart , you should climb the 350 steps which carry you to the top .
There you can enjoy a terrific view , not only will you see almost all the city but also you will discover another perspective of this magnific building .
Dear Mrs Smith

Place
The Musseum is situated in front of the sea in the centre of Acapulco .
Is situated in the top of a little mountain in the " old " part on the city .
You are able to get there by car or walking and see everything which was made at that time .
Conclusion
On the whole this is the best building in Acapulco for his history and reputation .
Is the best place to go and easy to get there .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
as the leader of the conference - organisation , I 'm glad if I can help you .
My wish is that nothing goes wrong .
So you have to know more details about our conference .
Your hotel is called Palace Hotel and it is placed in the city centre .
As far as I know this hotel is very comfortable .
There is also a subway - station near Palace Hotel .
Our college is not much far away .
You only have to take the subway - train .
After three stations you have arrived Brooklyn street .
When you come out of the subway you see our college .
The conference starts at 6 o'clock and ends at 8 o'clock .
The students have prepared a music program for the end - of - conference party .
There will also be an international buffet .
So do n't eat too much before you come .

You will have a lot of fund , I can tell you .
If you need any further information please call me .
My number is : 793354
Yours faithfully ,
The telephone is a very important invention , which has affected our lives .
It is a way for people to communicate although they are at two different places .
People use the telephone every day and it is one of the most important things in daily life .
In my opinion people need a telephone .
For example a telephone is very important in job - life .
Nowadays there are no companies which do not have a telephone .
Also it is god for people 's safety .
You can call the police if you are in danger or the ambulance if you are injured .
The people use the telephone also for their personal life .
For example when you want to talk to your family or to your friends who live far away .
Another aspect is that people have more time if they have a telephone .
They are able to give and receive informations very quickly .
This invention has made our lives easier and quickier .
The telephone has made my own life also easy and quick .
It makes something possible you can not do .
Finally I would say that the telephone is very efficient for people .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am writing to reply to your letter and to give answers to your questions .
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , a five star hotel , which offers many facilities .
It is famous for its friendly staff and comfortable rooms .
The students can get there with the No 35 bus .
They must get on the bus from the city centre and get off after five stations at Palace Station .
The hotel is opposite the station .
At the end - of - conference the college , in which the conference will be held , gives a party for all the students .
It will be offered light food , like sandwiches , pommes frites , chips , sweets and different drinks - no alcohol .
There will be life music and the students can dance and enjoy themselves .
It would be better to wear casual clothes , because they are more comfortable and are liked by students .
On the last day , the students can enjoy a sightseeing tour around the city , which can be arranged if the students want to .
The group can also visit the zoo , the opera or stay and relax at the college 's enormous garden and enjoy the settings .

At First , this international student conference has the intension of explain to students how important is the education .
In addition to this , we choose the luxuery Palace Hotel which is comfortable enough and in a good location .
The Palace Hotel is located in the centre of the city , so you can go by train , by bus or by car .
I suggest you should go by train and go out in the Museum Station .
The Conference will happen in the Hotel , which is so much easier .
The Conference , not being modest , it is a quite well organized .
It will starts at eight in the morning and will finish around five in the afternoon .
I suggest you should wear something informal .
Even though we want to make things as more comfortable as possible to our students .

Affecting Our Lifes
Cars , boats , motobikes , airplanes : Who did never use this once ?
This is a good question .
The humans seems always that they are running and the fastest of this inventions is certainly , the airplane .
At First , when Santos Dummont invented the airplane , he probably did n't think how the people could transform his creation .
In this world , where the nations fight to be the better one could n't be diferent : the airplane became the most important thing in the war .
Unfortunately , it was used to kill a lot of people .
How could a person come from Brazil to Australia ?
Maybe by boat , but it could take too long !
The best way is definetely , by air .
After this invention travel around the world is so much easier .
Now , we have to say thanks and congratulate all the creators who invented facility things for us .
So , the airplane is definitely an important invention , because it have changed people 's life in wars .
Until now , it is being important in the transport of thousands and thousands of people around the world .
Let 's congratulate Santos Dummont !

TELEVISION
What would our world be without television ?
It is n't easy giving an answer at this question .
Television is an important invention , it permitted us to better our way of communication .
This animated box can give us a lot of informations coming from all around the world .
Television has affected the " all days life , , , too . We can spend a lot of time enjoying ourselves with some programs , all what we have to do is watching .
And we like that , because it 's easier nothing doing than engaging ourselves in something that make us do something .
So television can be a positive or a negative invention , it depends on which use we want to do of this box .
Now we should be able to answer at the introducing question .
No , I do n't think so .
Television has become so important for us that we ca n't thinking that it could n't exist .
Dear Mrs Smith

Dear Mr Wolf
I am writing to answer your question about the information on an interesting building to visit .
I would like to introduce one building in my town .
" Sky Heaven " which is the name of the building , is for fifteen minutes from the centre of my town .
This building have a hundred floor and it takes for five minutes from the grand to the top in the elevator .
There are many facilities which are a museum , a exhibition and many gift shops where we might also enjoy going shopping .
The reason for my recommendation is that Sky Heaven is the highest building in the world .
You should get the top of the building and experience such a amazing view .
Another reason is that there is a good museum , which tell you about the history of my town so easily and clearly .
It is a good experience for your students .
I hope you will accept my recommendation and am looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am glad to helping you for the organisation of the international student conference .
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , and the best way to get from there to the conference is by tube , the building of the conference is then five minutes by footh .
At the end - of - conference there is a party , where we can eat something , dance and speak to each other about the conference .

Dear Morgan ,
I am writing a report , which will describe you the most important building of my town .
The most important building of Biasco is the , , Casa Cavalier Pellanda " .
It is an old big house of a rich lord in the middle of the town .
Into this house there is a big museum , where you could know the past of Biasco .
Under the museum there is a big dark place , where the wine is produced .
Your American students could learn how the , , Meriot ticinese " is produced and why is it so famous in Tiano .
I think that these suggestions could interest your student then Biasco , with its , , Casa Cavalier Pellanda " , is the middle points of two tailes - Leventina and Blenio - and the middle points of two similar but also different cultures too .
I hope that these informations will bring you to visit Biasco and its , , house " .
Yours faithfully ,
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
I am sorry to hear that Richard Brown is n't well and hope he 'll get better soon . I am more than happy to give you the nessessary information .
Your group has been booked into Palace Hotel which is only 2 miles away from our college .
The college will arrange a mini - bus to come and pick you up every morning at 8:45 , so you can arrive to the college around 9 o'clock and have some time before the conference starts at 9:15 .
The reason we do n't suggest you to take a walk from your hotel is that you 'd have to walk through a large building site which is not going to be suitable for a group of 20 students .
As you already know we are going to have the end - of - conference party where the Head of the college will give a small speech at the begining , then it will a buffet and a disco .
You do n't need to dress up smartly but please , make sure that your students do n't wear short or trainers .
Regarding to what you could do in your free afternoon on the day you leave I would suggest you to take the students to our History Museim .
It 's not very big but it has got some amazing information about the history of our town and their people .
There is also a gift shop in there , where your boys and girls can buy some soveniers for their families and friends .
I hope I 've answered all your questions but if you need anymore information , please let me know .
I am looking forward to seeing you all soon .
Best regards ,
To my personal opinion one of the most important and useful thing which has been invented in a car .
Cars take a big part in our life .
Everywhere you look you can see cars .
More and more people learn how to drive and choose to travel by car , because it saves a lot of time comper to travelling by public transport .
Cars are also more reliable than other types of transport .
You do n't have to wait on a bus stop on a cold and windy weather for a late bus , or being stuck on a train for an hour due to some railtrack repairs , you can just jump into a car , tune your radio onto your favourite station and have a plesant drive to your distanation .
Cars are even more important for emergency situations such as fire in a house or if somebody is critically ill .
Could you imagine if our police , doctors or fire - fighters had to get somewhere quickly on foot ?
I do n't think I need to comment on this .
From my personal experience I realised how it 's important to drive a car when I was living in Johanesburg in South Africa .
I arrived there with my family when my daughter was only 4 months old and I could n't drive at that time .
Johanesburg is a very dangerous place to live .
I could n't just go for a walk , it was too dangerous .
There was no public transport and I had to stay in the complex where we lived most of the time , and relay on other people to take me to a shop or the doctors or anywhere else .
There I soon realised that I had to learn how to drive if I wanted a quality life for my daughter and myself .
Since I passed my driving test I can not understand how I used to live without a car before .
I use my car every day everywhere I go and I absolutelly love it !
12th June 2001
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am writing to inform you some information about an international student conference .
First of all , the hotel which the group has been booked into is The Princes Hotel .
It is very near York Railway Station which you can get there easily .
By rail : get off at York station and you can walk from the station turn left and the hotel is on your left hand side .
By bus : most of the buses in York City Centre pass the station , or you can take a taxi .
Secondly , the conference is very important event for all of us , we agree to wear formal dresses .
For example , men should wear suits , ties and the so on .
In addition , at the end - of - conference party , we also have a country dancing show .
It could be very special because all the dancers are from our group .
Finally , on the last day we have an afternoon free .
It would be grateful If we could go for a walk around the city of York and visit the historic buildings .
If you could think of any other ideas It would be very kind of you . I would be grateful if my idea and all the information could help you .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Inventions have affected all our lives !
Nowadays , a lot of things are invented and make our lives are more convenient than those days .
A car is one of the invention which is very useful .
I think a car is very important to me because it 's very convenient for everyday life .
For example , I can travel to many places in the U.K. Especially , I live in Whitwell - on - the - Hill ( a village near Malton in North Yorkshire ) .
Can you imagine if I had n't got a car how could I go shopping , go to college and so on ?
In fact , there are buses ( number 843 and 845 ) which go pass my village but the bus fares is very expensive for me .
Apart from that it takes long time to go somewhere .
The car has largely affected my own life .
I can go anywhere by car a lot quicker than use public transports .
I can listen to the radio and sometimes can listen to Thai music which I brought some cassets with me from Thailand .
I took a car driving theory test last October and I passed it and I will take a pratice driving test very soon .
I think I have to drive the car myself , so that it will know more about the advantages of using the car .
In conclusion , I think car is very important to me and it has affected my own life .
If I have more money I will buy another car . I think it has more advantages than disadvantages .
So , we should say many thanks to the person who invented a car !

A traditional building which was built at the beginning of the century .
The hystorical museum is simply a symbol , a proof of what greek have always considered as main principal : their freedom .

Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
Thank you for your letter .
I am writing to answering our question .
Firstly , I already have booked Palace Hotel for the students .
There is the hotel near my college .
It takes five minutes to get my college by walking .
I will copy the map around the college .
Secondly , I will tell you about the end - of - conference party .
It will start at six o'clock .
The party will be held in the dinning room .
People who will attend the party are many professers , semi - professers and faculties .
So I suggest that the students should wear formal clothes .
For example , there are many shrines , temples , and castles .
I suggest that you should visit these places .
You will have a good time .
In addition , there are many other colleges .
You will be able to see many Japanese students .
I am looking forward to seeing you at the conference .
If you would like to gain more information , you will ask me everytime .
Yours sincerely .
I suggest that you should visit one building .
My town is the capital of Japan .
So there are many higher buildings .
I think it is like New York .
However , I have only one building which I want you to visit .
The name of the building is ' Sunshine 60 ' .
This is the highest building in Tokyo . I recommend to visit .
I have three reasons for my recommendation .
Firstly , there is the acquerium in the building .
In addition , this is the 60th floor , I went there first time I could n't believed it .
Secondly , if you visit there , you will see everywhere in Tokyo .
The scene of Tokyo is not beautiful , but you think that this city is a developing place .

Re : Information on an interesting building to visit
Introduction
Here is my report for American students who want information on an interesting building to visit in Ankara .
I would like to describe ' Anitkabir '
Findings
1 . This building 's name is ' Anitkabir ' and it is the biggest building in Ankara .
It built in 1953 .
It is placed in the middle of the forest .
There is different kind of bird and different kind of trees present .
2 .
It has very big museum inside the building and all building made from stone .
3 . This building 's security guards are very special soldiers .
Their aim is to protect the building from the enemies because there is also very big army museum available .
4 .
It has no charge for entrance and it has a good view for tourists to seeing Ankara from the hill .
It opens at 8.00 am to 5.00 pm
Recommendations
I recommend that it is the best building in Ankara to visit because it includes all Turkish history and very good sight seeing .
Dear Mrs. Smith ,
I am writing in reply to your letter about the internation student conference .
The hotel which we have reserved for your group is the Palace Hotel .
It is not far from our college , taking 20 minutes by car .
It would be a good idea to take a taxi from the hotel to the college because the total members of your group are 4 and taxi fare would not be expensive .
There is a taxi rank opposite the hotel .
Regarding the end - of - conference party on Thursday , it starts at 7 p.m. in the garden of the college .
You can wear either casual dresses or fancy ones because we have a fancy - dress competition and the raffle is a bottle of French champaign .
On Friday afternoon , it has set to be a free time .
Therefore , you can go shopping in the town centre which is near the college .
Many beautiful and traditional souvenirs can be found there .
The other suggestion is going to the flower market where is very famous for tourists because it covers 2 acres and there are plenty of flowers to buy .
Moreover , it is the biggest flower market in this area .
I look forward to meeting you soon and hope you have a safe journey .
Yours sincerely ,
Invented Light
There are many sources of light in this world such as sunlight , moonlight , candle light .
Some of them are natural whereas the others are not .
Owing to increasing demand of light for more activities , the natural source is not adequate .
There , electric light has invented .
Nowadays , the electric light has been becoming part of our lives , especially during the night .
Whatever we do at night , we need the electric light .
Have you ever imaged how this world would be if there was no electric light ?
It must have been a big impact on industry , agriculture and our lifestyle .
Think about when the electricity in your house got a short circuit .
Do you feel uncomfortable ?
Could you do anything much without light ?
In addition , the electric light is the manuscript of other electric equipments and they has become an important part of our life , too .
I think we should be grateful that we have got the electric light for comforting our lifestyle .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I was very please to receive your letter .
It is my pleasure to help you organising the international student conference .
Firstly , for your information , the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , which is located on the town centre .
Students can take the airport bus to the hotel directly when you arrive .
And the best way to get from there to the conference is to by coach , as there are about 35 internation students , they are all strangers here .
Therefore it is no good taking a bus .
I will help you to book the coach .
Secondly , the end - of - conference party will be held at college main hall , at 8:00 pm to 11:30 pm on 20th June .
There will be various kinds of food and drinks provided .
Moreover , students can dance and enjoy different sorts of music , for instance , rock , jazz , pop , garage and so on .
Furthermore , I suggest you and the students wearing pub - wears to it , as it is suitable for dancing .
Finally , on the last day , I suggest you could go the market at town during the 3-hour gap .
It is a nice place to buy the British style gifts to your family and friends .
You could also enjoy the tea at the cafés nearby .
I would be grateful to give any help if you need .
I am looking forward to seeing you .
Yours sincerely ,

Subject : Interesting building to visit in Hong Kong
Visiting Po Lin Temple
The purpose of this is to give information to the American students , describing Po Lin Temple is worth - visited .
1 .
Brief history of Po Lin Temple :
It was found in 1910 .
It is a traditional type of chinese temple .
Because of the 2nd World War , it was re - built in 1960 .
A big Buhha was built in 1997 just next to the temple , which is the largest outdoor Buhha in the world .
2 . Location :
The location of Po Lin Temple is in Lotus Island , which is the second biggest island in Hong Kong .
3 .
Opening and Closing time :
Po Lin Temple is opened to public from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm on Monday to Friday , and 9:00 am to 5:30 pm on Saturday and Sunday .
4 . Transports
You could take the MTR ( HK underground ) straight to Lotus Island or take the ferry to get there .
Then you need to take the bus A110 , A111 or A112 to Po Lin Temple .
It is quite convenient .
All the buses and MTR have air - condition .

Telephone saved my friendship
It 's very hard to decide which invention is the best .
Because all of them are so important in difference way .
As now I 'm being away from home , telephone is very important to me .
Having telephone I can call my mother , my friends which helping me from home sick , not completely but I think it 's better than other ways .
To hear the voice from the person you love is the feelling that hard to describe , it 's wonderful and so real , you can imagine their face clearly .
I had a problem with my best friend once when we keep in tuch through e - mail .
The problem is the language , we used English but we both were not very good at it by the time which made us misunderstand each other .
However , the problem solved by a telephone .
We are now still friend .
Thanks to the invention of the telephone .
Dear Mrs Smith
With reference to the information that you had requested , the hotel that had been booked is the Holiday Inn , in New Port and to get to the University of Wales wich is not far from the hotel , you only need to take a divertion where clearly indicate Carleon and once that you are on the main road all you need to do is to follow the country road which take you direct to the place .
Concerning to the Party at the end of the Conference , this will be formal there fore you will need formal clouding as you know there will be Company directors , Managers etc .
As for the last day I would suggest you to take a visit to the locall museum and the ruin 's Castle .
In the fist you will find a very intresting collection of Roman Vestiges , also you can visit another section wich it supoused to be a Roman cite .
Yours Sincerely ,
I always had consider myself been very looky to be born in the Century because all the amaizing human inventions .
As an example let 's have a look and we will see of this nation how it has developed .
We just need to think about the first world wold and all the inventions created thanks to the industrial revolution to these day .
However I feel that at the moment there should emerge more grups to control this development because the industrial polution that it has been created and it seems that its very little what has been done at the moment in relation to our embiroment .
I hope in the future there will be more and more people interested in this important issue .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
I read your letters and I 'm ready to help you .
I think that we have to think which hotel is better for the students .
I have an idea and I think that you will agree with me .
I was thinking about the Palace Hotel because it 's very nice and cheap .
It has comfortable bedrooms and place for parties .
You can book this hotel it 's the best and it 's near to conference it 's only 15 minutes by walk .
I think that it will be nice about the end - of - conference party if you will invite somebody to sing and give to the student the time to enjoy theirselves and to dance .
The party it will be nice .
The clothes now that they will wear it has to be smart , not how you are going to casino for example but nice casual , not with sports shoes or T - shirts .
On the last day in the afternoon that you have three ours free you can go for coffee or to visit some places .
Those are my ideas for the conference .
I hope that you will like it .
Your sincerely ,
Today our article it will be about an inventions that we need inour life .
I think that all this things we need in our life because it can give us a lot of things .
First of all we need the telephone in our house because it 's important to make call if you need something of if it something happend to your house and nobody is next to you .
The second one is the lamp , the electricity that is very important in our life .
In the past the people did n't have electicity and if they wanted for example to read or to cook something they used to do in the fire .
It 's important to have electricity because without this you ca n't do anything .
The other one is the television .
You must have TV because you can liten what it happend in the world and you can watch some places that you did n't go .
You can enjoy you time to watch a film if you have free time .
The boat it 's not so important but you can use it for fishing and to see some places .
The car now is very important in our life you can go wherever you want .
In this year the familys they have 3 cars in one family one by one person .
For me the most important thing is the telephone because without this you ca n't do anything , it 's part of my life .
Dear Maria Smith ,
First of all , the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel .
It is a big hotel because there will be a lot of people .
It has a swimming - pool and a nice bar .
The hotel is ten minutes far from the conference and there will be a bus available to go directly over there .
At the end of the conference , there will be a dinner in a luxurious restaurant so people must have nice clothes ; jean 's is not allowed .
Next to the restaurant , there is a disco for people who like dancing .
We can do a lot of things in my area .
We have the possibility to visit the old town , it 's very nice and there is a lot of shops .
We can visit the old castle or the painting museum too .
I find television the most important invention .
I think it 's good for old people because some of them can not go to the cinema anymore .
In one hand it 's because they have not enough money to pay it and in the other hand it 's because they ca n't move very well for example if they are disabled .
With television , old people are less alone because most of old woman have not her husband anymore .
Television is a good way to be informed with the news .
I prefer being informed by television than by newspapers , it 's more relaxing .
I think television is a good invention for children when they have free time and while they are watching television , we do n't have to look after them if we have something important to do .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I 'm very glad to be able to help you out with such sutiation .
First of all , the group has been booked into ' THE PALACE HOTEL ' .
You wo n't have any problem to find the college because it 's in front of the Hotel , and the conference will be there .
As you know , the conference will start at 11:00 and it will finish at 13:00 , but we will have lunch altogether at 13:30 in the college 's hall until 14:30 .
You 'll have to wear a white shirt and blue trousers , if you want you will be able to wear a blue jacket .
When we had finished you 'll be able to enjoy yourself in our cinema or television room , but if you prefer other things , we 've got a swimming pool and a library , it will your own choice .
I hope it was useful for you .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Group leader ,
In order of your request , I 'm going to give you some information about which is the best place to visit in this town , Fuengirola .

The hotel where your group has been booked is the Palace Hotel .
It is a very nice hotel in the centre of the city , and that is very near of the college which the conference is into , five minutes walking .
Going walking is quicker than waiting for a taxi or a bus .
When you arrive to the Colleges there will be people indicating the way to the conference room .
At the end of the conference we are doing a party with some cold good and some drinks .
There will be music as well for dancing .
The director of the College has suggested to wear smart clothes for that occasion and I give you the same advice .
About the afternoon before leaving I have some suggestions .
In the area of the Hotel there are two interesting places to visit .
One is the Picasso museum and the other is an important Gallery where you can enjoy seeing differents kinds of paintings .

There is an invention that I think that has been very important : the computer .
The computer is very useful and It has affect our own lifes , in differents meanings .
The computer has done easy a lot of works .
For works that you needed , for example three hours you can do them in ten minutes ; the same !
But computers do n't have affected only in a good way because thank you to computers the number the places of work for the persons is minor .
But , definetely they has been a very important invention .
The last relationed with computers is internet .
By internet you can comunicate with people of differents places of the world at the same moment .
And you can take lots of informations about a lot of things .
Every thing that you need you can find it in internet .
Nowadays computer are very developmented and it is increasing .
What will be the next ?
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
I have received your letter and I am glad I can help you .
You have been booked to stay in the Palace Hotel which is a very pleasant hotel not far away from here .
The best way to get here is ; once you have gone out of the hotel , turn right , then follow the signs to the hospital , because it is just by our college .
When you are in the college ask for me .
The conference will take one hour , and , at 8 o'clock the party will start , it is a formal party and you should wear formal stuff .
The dress code is : no jeans .
We will prove you with food and drinks .
For your free hours I have quite a few ideas .
There are lots of things to do here .
We have got a museum which is just at two minutes from your hotel .
You can also go to a nearby park and eat something in the café .
If you go to the main street you will find a street full of shops and I am sure the students would like that .
I hope this information will be helpful .
If you have any other questions , please , do contact me .
Looking forward to seeing you soon .
Your sincerely ,
THE MOBILE PHONE
The mobile phone has completely changed our lives , it is an instrument which I can not imagine myself living without .
Apart from being in - fashion it is also a very helpful machine .
Do you remember that day when you got stuck in the middle of the road with your car which would n't work ?
What would you have done in that moment without a mobile phone ?
You were at home in less than ten minutes just because you had a mobile phone with you , amazing , is n't it ?
Nowadays , everyone has a mobile phone .
I am fifteen years old and everybody in my year has got a mobile phone .
Five years ago you would n't have even thought about it .
It has been a plus for me .
For example , now my parents allow me to go to more places just because I have my mobile with me , and , sending text messages is an addiction which every teenager is obsessed with .
All over , the invention of this little device is a big plus for everyone .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am writing to inform you that I have recieved a letter from you about helping you to organise an international student conference in my college .
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is not very far from my college .
However , due to the congestions and delay near the hotel , the best way to get from there to the conference is by underground , Victoria Street station .
You would arrive at the other station opposite my college in approximately 15 minutes .
At the end - of - conference party , you may either leave the party or stay in the college for more activities .
All different types of clothing could be worn however jean wears and T - shirts would be common on that day .
Instead staying in the hotel for the last three hours , I suggest that you could perhaps visit our town centre .
The popular attractions in our town , including the art gallery , museum , aquarium , market square , could be found near our monument of our town , the Saltisy Bridge .
I am looking forward to see you soon .
Yours sincerely ,

The Students , who were questioned said that there are a lot of interesting buildings in our City .
However the majority of people point out one a very old building , which you can find at Barkeley Square .
Most of the Students found this building very particular , because it reflects our history , tradition and culture .
If you visit the building , you will get impression , feeling , that you are in past times .
This building attracts a lot of people , - because it has a very particular style with majestic , antique windows .
In addition , I also visited this place - and I was very impressed .
Finally I would recommend you visited Barkely Square area .
In this area you could also find another different buildings , which would you attract .

Also there is a bus provided for the organisation to take all the students at the hotel .
At the end of the conference it will be a party .
I might suggest you to wear a casual dress , because many students feels relaxing after the whole day sitting and listening all the conference .
The party is amazed by a group of musicians , and as I remembered from last year it was unforgiven , because all the people where dancing and having a lot of fun .
It is a well - situated town with a lot of museums to visit especially " the History museum " wich I visited last year , and I think you can enjoy as well .
It does n't take a lot of time to visit and the entrance is free .
Whising I 've been very helpful to you .
Yours sincerely ,
TELEPHONE CHANGE OUR LIFES
It 's imposible Nowdays to think a life without that invention how quickly affects our life especially in business .
We ca n't imagine a big company without a phone , that can makes business more quickly than anything else .
Also , I was asking too many people in the street .
Could you live without telephone ?
The answer was all the same " Imposible " .
An old woman told me how important was the phone when her only son was abroad studing computers in the " Chicago University " , she told me that every night was expecting a call from her son , for her was the line of the hapiness .
However it was one persone wich he told me , it was n't happy at all with the phone , because he used to writte a lot , especially at Christmas to wish all his friends a very nice Christmas but now everybody phone him losing a very old fashion .
In my opinion this little " box " that everybody has at home can safe your life , especially if you need to ring a doctor in an emergency situation .
In conclusion do n't make a very long phone calls and you wo n't have to pay a very expensive bill .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith
Thank you for your letter .
It 's a shame that I wo n't see Richard because of his illness , but I 'm willing to help you as much as I can .
Then I will give you some information which you asked for in your letter .
Firstly , about your accomodation , our college which I belong to offers visitor free accomodations with full of facilities .
( for example bath , car park , free internet access , etc . )
They also are located in our campus so you can get to the conference by walk .
Secondly , as you know we 'll have a party after the conference , which will be taken place at our student council hall with some meals .
This party is unlikely to be that formal , but I recommend you not to wear jeans and trainners .
At last , if you have free time for couple of ours , you 'd better visit Kamakura City , which is 30 minutes from our campus by train .
That is very traditional Japanese city where so many temple and heritages are there .
I 'm sure you 'll enjoy it and maybe get familier with our culture .
By the way , if you have any other questions , please send me a letter again .
Oh Baby , I ca n't live without you !
These days , we 've been sorrounded with so any different kinds of products which our ancestors invented .
In our daily life , however , we seldom notice how much convinient life we 've got , what is more , how much inconvinient our grandparents had got .
How nasty we are !
Let us try to appreciate thier importance again .
As for me , the invention which is most important to me is a personal computer . I have been a full time student in the university at home , and their classes all requires us to have personal computer and use them at any times .
When you take the class on computer programming , you will definetly need one and it holds true for the class on politics , because you have to study statistic on your computer for doing social research and some analysys .
My professor said ' go and get familier with your computer , otherwise you 'll fail ' .
I find it amazingly easy to forget the importance of inventions which we useually use without any questione .
That 's the nature of human being .
But , I think it 's not only our fault but the evidence of how much they integrate in our life .
Dear mrs smith
I received your letter asking some information about conference

it is really easy to reach to the conference from the hotel .
The bus running front of the hotel .

Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am writing in reply to your letter , which I received yesterday .
Below is a piece of information you will need for the next international student conference at Bournemouth College and some recommendations , which might be useful for the students .
First of all , the hotel booked for the group is the Palace Hotel , which is very impressive in terms of comfort and facilities .
This is a very central hotel located not far away from the conference hall .
You will be able to get there either by bus ( no 150 ) or on foot .
Next you are welcome to attend the party organized at the end of the conference .
It will begin at elevenish p.m. and may last the whole night .
People are going to be disguised there and it would be a good idea to wear extravagant multi - coloured clothes .
Finally I think that you should jump at opportunity to go to the historical Pergam 's Museum before leaving .
Some of the most amazing masterpieces are exposed there .
I wish you in advance a wonderful trip and look forward to meeting you in Bournemouth .
Your sincerely
To : ( group leader )
From :
Subject : Bournemouth National Museum
As requested I visited the Bournemouth National Museum , which is , to my mind , one of the most interesting buildings of the area .
Below is a summary of the most important relevant points and some recommendations you may need .
1 . Architecture
The architecture of the building in itself is really breathtaking in terms of luxury and ornamentation choice .
Even if the architectural style may seem a bit ' heavy , this building is really a masterpiece with no similar comparison all over the world .
2 . Exposition
Although I have to admit that it is very tiring to visit the whole museum in one day , it is such a rewarding and enriching time that people get never tired of looking at the paintings and sculptures of each section of the museum .
3 . Restaurant
The adjoining restaurant is very enjoyable as well .
The waiters are friendly and always ready to give advice .
In fact it is just what visitors need after their trip through the museum .
To sum up , I would say that this museum is more interesting than the other museums , because you can enjoy not only wonderful masterpieces but also a very uncommon architecture and a quiet restaurant to have a rest if you need to .
Dear Mrs. Smith ,
In reply to your letter , I would like to answer your questions and give you more information .
Firstly , the hotel in which the group is going to stay is ' Palace Hotel ' .
Secondly , the easiest way to travel from the hotel to the conference is by a local bus .
There is a bus stop in front of the hotel and no.31 or 3 will take you directly to the conference .
Thirdly , the end - of - conference party would be a small disco , with a variety of drinks and food provided .
Therefore , you could wear something quite casual .
Lastly , on the last day , I would suggest you to visit the Edinburgh Castle and the National Scottish Museum , as both of them are very interesting and have the student discount .
I hope this letter should help you with enough information .
Yours sincerely ,
Could modern people live without a light bulb ?
Well , I do n't think so .
Only people who could live without it , must be extremely weird or somebody in a very difficult situation !
We are nearly always surrounded by the ' man - made ' light .
With it , we read , study , walk , and so on .
In the past people relied on the sunlight , moonlight and the light from fire .
These were , however , very unreliable when the weather was bad and when the fuel ran out .
They had to read , study and walk in the dark .
Today , this kind of thing hardly happens !
Well , unless there was n't anything wrong with the power supply .
I remember when I was about 5 , I visited a museum with my family .
While I was in toilet , all the light was turned off !
I screamed and cried since I 'd never experienced being in a complete darkness before .
When the light was turned on again , I realised how important even a single light bulb would be , and I was sure I can never , ever live without it .
Dear Maria ,
First of all , I am sorry to hear that Richard is ill .
As the conference must go on , I will give you the information you asked for in order to work on with this conference .
According to the hotel , the group has been arranged to stay in a hotel which is very near the place we are going to have the conference .
The hotel is The Palace Hotel .
It'is just only 5 minutes walk from there to the conference and I would like to suggest that this is the best way to get to the conference .
About the party , we will have a party at the end of the conference at the hotel you will stay .
The party will be in a friendly atmosphere so do n't worry about what to wear .
There will be only our group , so dress whatever you want and enjoy ourselves .
The shopping centre is just right opposite of the hotel , however , some people may want to just wait at the hotel , having a cup of coffee .
The cafe in the hotel is available .
I hope that information will be useful .
If you have any questions I am more than happy to help .
I look forward to seeing you at the conference .
Yours sincerely .
Could you live without this ?
How would you manage to get yourself ready to go to work .
How would you know what happens in the whole wide world or even how you would get yourself breakfast without toaster ! ! !
How would you cope with all those ?
Thank god for those who had created the electricity and had appliedapplied it into every appliances .
The electricity is a clever invention .
Everything bases on the use of electricity , for instance from a little bulb light to the most complicated computer system which stored priceless information !
Life would n't be easy if we did n't have electricity .
The electricity is very important in keeping our lives go .
No matter where you are , what you do , apparantly , you need the electricity .
Let 's think this way , if we did n't have the electricity , there would be no other inventions at all ! !
I , personally , could n't live without the electricity .
It has already affected and play a great role in my life .
I watch the television and use the computer everyday .
Moreover , other facilities in my house , telephone , air - conditioner , fridge , for example , they are all need the electricity . That'is why it is very important to my life .
Dear Mrs. Smith
my name is ... , I am a local student and i will give you the requested information .
The rooms for your students have been booked at the Palace Hotel near the city - centre .
The hotel is just three busstops away from our college .
So you and your students can take the bus from the central busstation that is right in front of your hotel to get to the conference .
The end - of - conference party starts just one our after the end of the conference .
It is located in our sports hall .
There will be live music and a midnight dinner .
So you do n't have to appear very noble dressed , just as you like it ( there is no order - you may wear what you want ) .
For your last day I think it would be interesting to vistit our historical and famous city - centre .
I will organize a tourist guide to give us information about the old buildings and sights .
If you have any more questions write me a short letter .
Yours sincerely
The invention of the car was a great point in history .
From there on people got mobile and had the possibility to travel wherever they wanted .
Of course within the physical barriers .
People now had the chance to move to far away places to spend their leassure time , to relax , or just to see something different than their home - countryside .
In my life the car has an enormous influence . I come from a rural area .
The next city is 15 km away and there is no acceptable bus - or rail connection to go there .
It has been quiet hard to me not to have the opportunities for my free time like my friends that lived in or near the city .
I just had no possibility to meet them after school , because I had no vehicle to get there .
I always needed my Mom or my Dad to take me where I wanted to go .
Today I have my own car and I use it daily to get to work and to meet my friends at any place and any time .
So with my car I achieved a great freedom .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am applying your letter where you asked for some information about the conference in Peterborough Regional College .
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is situated in the city center , at 15 minutes walking from where the conference take place in .
In the next page there is a map showing you the best way to get to the conference that will be at the Regional College .
The conference will start at 7 p.m , the same day we expect , the 18th of June .
Our director will make a speech afterwards and there will be a party with some snacks , drinks and music .
For the people interested in , there will be also an amusement karaoke .
Everybody should wear formal clothes , at least , a little bit formal .
No jeans and tee - shirts .
There is a lot of places you can visit in Peterborough .
We have a Cathedral you can visit anytime and the river side , which is the best if it is a nice day , sunny an warm , for take a walk .
For any details look in the next page map .
Yours sincerely ,
Alice knew that is was going to be a very special day for her .
She had a dream where somebody told her that that day would be special .
So , she took the bus , like every morning , and she went to school .
But that day was a little bit different : she had her maths exam .
She had never passed an maths exam and she was really nervous .
Half an hour before the exam she went to the cafeteria to take a cup of tea .
She sat down and what a surprise she found a lottery ticket .
Nobody was around her , so she took the ticket .
Drank her cup of tea and she went to the classroom where the exam took place .
She did the exam really well , she was very surprised , and after the exam she went home .
She spend the rest of the day listening to music while she was thinking about the lottery ticket and waiting for the TV show at 8 o'clock .
At the time , she turned on the TV and while the lottery 's man was shouting the winning numbers , she checked hers and what was the surprise that the last 4 numbers were the same ! !
She win £ 500 ! ! !
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
I have just received a letter from you .
I am really appreciate your interesting about our conference .
Firstly , the Palace hotel is your accommodation which you have booked .
This is very nice hotel and I am sure you will be very pleased with staying there .
Secondly , you will have no problems finding the conference .

However , we have already prepared a mini - bus for you .
The bus will be in front of your hotel at 1 p.m. and it will take you to the conference .
Thirdly , we will have the end - of - conference party at 6 p.m. You can have dinner with wine which is very famous in our area and also you can enjoy the semi - classical concert which we have prepared for 3 months .
But I hope you will wear formal suit and dress .
You will not be allowed to enter this party unless you wear casual clothes .

Inventions have affected all our lives !
What is it what we use every day many hours ?
Sometime 's early in the morning until late in the evening .
Yes it is the TV .
It is well know in almost all family , often with a lot of different cannels .
First of all , the TV can tell us news in a short time , what happened all over the world .
Another point in favour of the invention for the TV is , that they telling about interesting reports , for instance about animals or different culture from other countrys .
Furthermore they have a lot of different programme , usually something for everybody .
It could be also relaxing to sit on the sofa after a busy day at work .
Finally , the TV is in my opinion very useful for getting important information , you can watching the weather and all of them were present in wonderful colour .
To sum up , in my opinion the TV is a very good and useful invention .
However , they send a lot of violence which is not good for the children .
I can not imagine to live without televison , it is something what we need for our education , for getting news and other helpful information .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
Thank you for your letter .
Surely I 'll try to help you as good as I can .
First , I tell you the name of the hotel , it 's the Palace Hotel .
Fortunately , it is not far from our college .
For getting from the hotel to the conference , you only have to take bus no.7 and get off at St. James College , where the conference will take place .
About the end - of - conference party I can only say that a band will be playing the whole night , and a special guest I still do n't know will be expected .
I suggest to wear casual clothes , I think there 's no need of school uniforms .
To answer your last question , I would propose you to attend the local zoo , because many baby animals were born in the past few days .
Dear Mrs Smith , I hope the given information is useful for you .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you at the conference .
Yours sincerely ,
The telephone
Could you imagine there 's no telephone ringing in an office ?
Or to live your live without chatting for hours with your best friend ?
Could you ?
I ca n't !
The telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in the end of the 19th century .
It was an invention nobody thought how important and how widespread it would be in future .
Nowadays almost every household in the western world owns a telephone , and calling to relatives or friends spread all over the world is no strange thing .
People need the telephone not only for chatting , but also for exchanging information in a very short and direct way with the possibility to answer immediately .
When I was a child , we had no telephone at home , and I always had to go to a phone box in the centre of our village .
Now I have my own flat , and the first piece of furniture I 've bought was the telephone . I 'll never take it away from my home .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
I want to inform you that I had already talked to Richard Brown and he informed me about the conference .
Next week I will be start organising some events for this conference .
The event will organize at the Palace Hotel .
The same hotel that will you stay .
Palace Hotel is opposite the park ' Clifton ' , which is near the college .
We chose that hotel because is it near the college and we do n't need to use a transport .
Because you know where is the college and you need to bring with me some things at the college to hotel I think that is better to come all the group in college and then we can go all together to the ' Palace Hotel ' .
The conference start at 9:00 o'clock you need to be at the college half an hour before .
Concerning the end - of - conference I 'm thinking about some dance and singing events .
Tell me your idea .
About the clothes that we need to wear , must be uniform , because is the best conference to London and every year are coming lectures from other colleges .
Finally on the last day we have organised a seeing - crossing around London . You will have the opportunity visiting some museums and zoo parks .
I think it is a nice idea .
If you want more information you can call me my telephone number is 047***. Please if you have more ideas send me a letter .
Yours Sincerely ,
Nowdays all the people have a telephone .
Telephone is part of our life .
It is one of the most important investigation all over the world .
Telephone is type of communication .
If you want to talk with your friends , parents , partner or to ask something , you can call them without wondering how can be communicate with them .
Especial if some of your relatives or friends are living in other country you can communicate with them and everyday and you do n't feel that they are far a way from you .
Today with the development of technology has been improved and the abilities of the telephone .
They are telephones that you have the opportunity to talk with more than one people at the line .
Also you can leave a message if you call and ca n't find someone .
The last type of telephone , is the mobile phone .
You can use it everywhere and at anytime .
Finally telephone except|apart from type of communication , is type and socialisation .
Nowadays who are so bussy and we do n't have free time to see our friends , we can call them and talk or chat with them .
Especial the young people are using many hours the telephone and that is trouble for their parents .
Telephone is very important investigation if we can use it correct without use it as type of entertaiment as they are doing nowadys many people .
Dear Mrs Smith
As you know , a hotel whose name is Palace Hotel has been booked for your group .
The best way to get from there to the conference is to take a taxi .
I am afraid there are no buses to get there .
We will have a great party at the end of the conference .
The party will be formal , therefore you have to wear formal clothes like a suit or a dress .
As you know , it is not suitable to wear a jean or something .
On your last day you have an afternoon free .
In my area there is a fantastic park , which is the most famous park in the country .
You can find a lot of things to do or to see .
You can visit the zoo or walk around the amazing lake in the park .
I hope you will find all the details , which you would like to have in the letter .
If you need any information , please let me know .
Your Sincerely ,
Power Of Computurs .
How much can a computer affect your life ? I think it effects more than you think .
When I was a child I always wanted to get the lyrics of the songs that I liked , but it was nearly impossible to have them .
I felt lack of them .
I first bought a computer as I was in university .
It was so necessary for me because I wanted to be a computer programmer .
That time I met the magic world of computers .
Linking to the internet was so popular .
Internet was something amazing for me .
Can you think you have every information you need whenever you want ?
Can you think you contact with anyone who is from any country whenever you want ?
I meet a lot of people on internet and it really interest me .
I learn a lot about their culture by speaking them on internet .
I was n't able to imagine this before .
In addition this , today companies can do nothing without a computer .
Everything in this world works with computers from now on .
Computers changed my life style , my opinion about the world .
And they effect everyone 's life directly or indirectly .
Dear Mrs M. Smith ,
I am writing in order to reply to your letter and to give you all the information that you requested .
First of all the hotel is the Palace Hotel , 82 Regent Street , so that it is very easy to reach the conference .
In fact you can take the bus number 3 ; as you can see , the bus stop is just in front of the hotel , then you can get off immediately after the church that you pass , on your right hand .
Secondly , we will have the party in the hotel at 8.00 o'clock and a buffet will be served at 8.30 p.m. It would be also possible to get some vegetarian food and drink cocktails free of charge . I would recommend your students to bring their Identity Card to prove their age .
What is more , I would suggest to wear very smart dress and for men it is oblidged the tie .
Finally , if I were you I would go shopping to the City Centre to spend your last hours .
However , if you re interested in Archeology you should vitis the History Museum in Garden Square .
I hope you will find my letter of interest and I look forward to seeing you .
Yours Sincerely ,
Have you ever thought to live without your car ?
How can you manage your daily life without it ?
I the last fourty years people seem to be completely addicted by using their own car .
It is said that the majority of the citizens has got a car and unfortunately this is the reason why cities are getting more polluted .
On the other hand , this kind of facility has made our life more comfortable and easy .
In fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our family and carring lugguage and shopping bags .
Cars are able to cover not only short distance but also can be used for long journey .
For example , in the past it would had been extremely exhausting travelling riding a hourse but nowadays we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of optionals to choose with .
However , I have to say that it has made people be lazy and at the same time stressed due to the traffic .
On the other hand one of the main advantages is that we can save time and money as cars have long last and allowe us travelling quickly .
That 's why I could n't image my life without it .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
Thank you for your letter which I received last week .
If student is ill , we will return the money but you should tell us untill one week before we start .
And you are staying the Palace Hotel , which is located in town Centre .
You can take buses or our school buses .
It costs forty pence .
If you take public buses , it costs more expensive than school bus .
The end - of - conference party is going to start from Seven o'clock .
One of our teacher , who will be voted by student is making speech for one hour .
After , student is making speech about what he or she have learned . and diner .
In my opinion , you should wear normal cloth .
I would like to suggest that you should visit building of sixty two which is consisted on sixty second floor .
There are eye - max cinema , museums , garelty .
This is very famous in our city .
I hope that my advice will help you .
I look forward to hearing soon from you .
Yours sincerely

About the party which is just at the end of the conference , a good it would be a dance party and the students do n't really need to wear special clothes , it 's just to have a little dance and meet all the students , after the party there is a small trip to the old part of the city and I think it would be a good choice to spend the last three hours that you have left before go back .
I hope this letter aswer all your questions , if you whant to know more about it just give me a call or send me a letter .
your sincerely
The aim of this report is to give some information about The new Acapulco resart buildings which was build 10 years ago and it is one of the first buildings that was build with the latest tecnonology and made by a important Mexican arquitector .
In addition the resort has an interesting History background about arquitectory and the best facilities and activities that you could have in Mexico for example , it provides differents kinds of tours around Mexico .
On the contrary it is far away from the city and it has difficult transport facilities .
In spite of the disadvantages , I would strongly recomended to students and public to visit the new Acapulco resort buildings . and have a great experience knowing about buildings history and at the same time traveling around Mexico .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
I am afraid to hear that Mr. Brown is ill I hope it wo n't be grave .
However , I will be glad to give you as much information as you need and I hope you will find it helpful .
the name of the hotel in which the group is going to stay in is Palace Hotel , to get there you must go to the centre of town , all buses are going there , Once you are in the centre Palace Hotel is right in front of the tourism information office .
For the end - of - conference party we have booked one of the halls of the hotel and they will provide us life music and cattering .
Due the hotel is such an elegant place I would suggest to dress up in night clothes .
Finally , to fill your free afternoon I would hardly recomend to visit the cathedral and have a walk arround the old part of the city , if you like it will be my pleasure to show you the souroundings .
Yours sincerely ,
Chairs are not only part of the forniture , they are also objects of decoration and you can even find some in museums as art symbols .
Who could have invented such a useful item ?
In fact , nobody has got this clue , but it must have been the most clever person on earth !
the world is packed with so many tipes of chairs , from the common woden ones to the most sophisticate and comfortables others finding a baste range of prices .
From my point of view the chair is without a doubt the most usefull gadget ever invented .
Some people use them in their work , others are wishing to get one by the end of the day and for some other people a while chair represents the possibility of mouvement .
Although is worth to say that not everybody can chose his ideal chair there is a special one for each of us .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
Thank you for your letter .
I am glad to help you for the organisation of the conference .
I phoned to the tourist information last week and I got some information about the accomodation of the students .
I think we should book at the Palace Hotel .
It is an outstanding building situated in the city centre .
The Hotel is in a good position , 10 minutes walk from the conference and I think the best way to reach it is on foot .
I am sure the students will enjoy walking in the streets of the town .
The conference starts at 5 o'clock in the afternoon and finishes at 7 pm .
I think they should wear smart dress , because there will be lots of interesting people and important meeting .
In conclusion , for the last day , I thought it will be very interesting for the students to visit the town and appreciate its monuments and art .
On the other hand , if you prefer to have a relaxing day , you could have a pic - nic in the wonderful park .
I hope my suggestion and Idea will help you to organise the meeting .
I look forward to receiving your confirmation .
Yours ,

INTRODUCTION :
As requested , the aim of this report is to assess the suitbility for a group of American students for the visit at the Etruscan Museum .
GENERAL INFORMATION :
The museum is situated in the centre of Populoniou , the picturesque fishing village on the Etruscan Coast .
Populoniou is about 15 Km . from Piombino and it can be reached by well - organised means of transport .
DESCRIPTION :
The Etruscan Museum is one of the most attractive building in my town .
It contains lots of archeological Etruscans founded and some remains about Etruscans neoropolis .
The entrance fee is £ 7 each student .
POSITIVE ASPECTS
1 . The Museum is well - organised for tourists .
There are some shops , café and toilets .
Also there are some free handphones , that explain the history of the museum .
2 .
After their visit into the Museum , they could enjoy the superb view of the sea and the tuscan Archipelago , and they could have a pic - nic on the beach .
NEGATIVE ASPECTS
1 .
The negative aspect of the museum is that is quite expensive for students .
CONCLUSION :
Although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students , I strongly reccomend it for their excursion and their interests .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
I am writing to give you some information asked in your letter , which I received this morning .
Your group has been booked in Palace Hotel which is one of the most comfortable hotels in London .
Personally , I am glad that you will have this opportunity to use its various facilities .
It is based in the city centre and is about half an hour by underground from the conference .
In my oppinion the easiest way to get there from the conference would be by taking the Picadelly line .
However you would take bus number 150 , if you would like to have a look at the city centre and you have some free time also .
Regarding to the end - of - conference party , I would suggest to wear some dress for a woman and an elegant suit for a man , though , it is no formal do .
The party will finish quite late so we 've decided to provide a bus which would take you to the hotel safely .
Basicaly , during three hour time in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of interesting places of London .
However you would have a long walk along the river to take some essential photos .
I look forward to welcoming you .
Yours sincerely
Are you always happy when your telephon ring ?
As far as I am concerned the telephone was invented in 19th century .
It has been affecting our lifes very quickly , although there were some different ways of communication as TV , for instance .
Since the internet was introduced , many of us would n't have imagined the lifes without this .
We were able even to have our own telephone kept in our pocket for a some time .
However , are you always happy when your personal phone rings .
On the other hand I wonder whether you have experienced some situations when you would n't have your mobile switched on .
This invention has affected my life completely .
Since I have been traveling around the world I would have imagined beeing in tough with my family or friends without internet or my mobile phone .
In spite of having the opportunity of keeping contact with friends at the time we are far away from home , we should have been knowledge how to use it without interrupting others .

The Telephone : A great invention .
Imagine your life without a telephone .
Yes , I know , it is just hard to imagine our lives without this invention .
Think about the people living in the time it was invented .
Must had been such a exciting thing being able to talk to someone living thousands of miles for ........ and now for us is just as simple as dial a number and talk to whoever we want to .
Of course is nice to have a phone conversation with friends or family , but the telephone is also very important for business and emergencies .
For example , I work for a bank , and we need to have weekly meetings with our Director living 800 kilometers far , and he does n't have to come here , we just have a phone conference where everybody can talks , and that is it !
What about emergencies ?
A phone call in time for an ambulance can save the life of many people having a heart attack .
We sometimes do n't realize the importance of some inventions we use in our everyday life .
But think .... , what would we do without them !
Dear Mrs Maria .
I am one of all students and I am going to give you an information , all you need .
We have been booked the hotel for you and the name of hotel is " Palace Hotel " quite near shopping centre .
It is not far aways , you just go along Park Road about ten minutes .
Then you will arrive at Palace Hotel on the left handside of you .
About the end - of - conference party .
We are going to have a dinner before the end and at the end we are going to bring you to the Hotel , you need to wear a night - dress or suit and bow tie .
Finally , on the last day you have three hours before you catch the plane so we suggestion , you can go to shopping centre and buy something for your special person or go to museam because this museam is the biggest in the world now It is up to you .
yours sincerely

INVENTIONS HAVE AFFECTED ALL OUR LIVES !
The invention without no doubt , that has affected my own life by far is the car .
Cars have definitely changed all our lives , and I am not refering only in a positive way , but in a negative way as well .
Picture this : a big city such as London or New York with no cars on their streets .
Could you imagine it ?
To be honest , I ca n't .
Cars are part of our daily lives .
Traffic jams make people nervous , sometimes really upset and violent .
But , anyway , people use cars .
If we do n't use them we suffer from them .
In my case I use public transport during the week to go to work but I could hardly imagine my weekends without my beloved car .
I really need it to escape from the pollution , mainly caused by cars and any other four - wheel motored vehicle .
Is n't that contradictorious ?
To go to the countryside and being able to breath fresh , non - polluted air , I use my car , which , as far as I am concerned does not help to maintain a clean air at all .
Therefore I am thinking in selling my car , which has changed my life over the last 10 years , which has given me a kind of freedom , which has gone with me to all sort of fantastic places , and change my life for a new life : whithout car .
Dear Mrs Smith .
I have just received your letter .
It was very sorry news to Richard Brown .
I have given much information of the international student conference .
Firstly , the conference will take place in the Palace Hotel and we get from our college to there by bus .

Secondly , there are some programme that are very great .
First time , the conference 's head make a short speech and then we have dinner and drinks .
Finally we enjoy a disco party so you wear a suiteable dress .
On the last day I go to your house and then we think about our 's conference plane .
I hope it will be a successful conference .
See you soon .
Yours sincerely

Hampton Court Palace
Introduction :
I have been asked for information on an interesting building to visit .
I went to Hampton Court last year , and I think it is a great place to visit .
Location :
Hampton Court palace is localizated in Hampton Court .
In addition to that , I think this town is wonderful and it has a magical beauty .
transport :

From there depart the trains to Hampton Court .
Moreover , I think by train is the best way to get there , because Hampton Court train station is very close to Hampton Court palace .
Price :
there is a great price for children , students , adults and families .
They are between three and six pounds each .
Conclusion :
Hampton Court Palace is a building with lots of history and interesting things to see .
And also it would be an excellent chance for this group of American students to see it .
To : Mrs. Smith
Thank you for your letter , which arrived on second .
June .
I am very pleased to help to organize this Conference in our College , which will hold at Conference Centre at Bromley College starting on 20th June for 3 days .
please find information your required as follows :
We have booked the hotel for the group .
Called " palace Hotel " which is about 10 miles away from our College , the hotel will have a coach to pick the group up from the airport on 19th of June and then take the group to Conference and return to hotel every day .
Regarding to the end - of - conference party .
We have planed a barbecue at 5 oo pm . on our most idyllic play field which is over looking the endless Countryside and farms .
At 7:00pm .
we can move to our student hall to have a disc dance until 10:00pm .
On the last day , we have arranged a small party in the hotel , then we all set up to have a sightseeing Bromley town center for about two hours before you leave for airport .
Bromley town center is the most beautiful shopping centre in South East London .
There are many historical buildings remain .
I think the students will enjoy this sightseeing .
Yours . sincerely ,
We need light every day , not just night time .
We need lamp light in offices or schools or some places during the day time .
How is the wonderful life after invention the light .
Here we just talk about the light we invented apart from nature light .
When I was small , we lived in country yard , I remembered , we used to have oil lamps which used a cotton string dipping in the oil in the small bottle and made it burned the tip of the cotton string to give us light during the night time , it was very little light on , and many things we could n't do under the oil lamps because the light range was very small .
There was no any light outside our house , no light on the road or field either .
I was always very scared whenever or wherever . because most places .
Covered by dark , dark and dark .
This scaring dark is still affecting my life now .
I never stayed out after dark today except accompanying by my family .
What a biggest person on the earth , who invented the light , Einstein was .
He created another day time after sunset , people use it to do anything they want to do , We believe we ca n't live without light today , specially in city life , we have a long time to spend for the activities after Sun going to bed .
Which we definately need light to keep on . I dare to say , without light , our life will go into a dark , dark hell .

Introduction
The aim of this report is giving some suggestions to a group of American students who has just arrived in Rome and want some information about an interesting building to visit .
Rome is a big city where they can find several moments and important buildings , for this reason I would suggest them to visit
1 ) " Fontana di Trevi " sited in Trevis Square in the center of Rome .
That 's a small square where there is a fountain very big .
It was built by Canovas architect in 1638 .
That is the fountain which " Dolce Vita " film was taken place .
2 ) For other hand , there is Villa Borghese Building , That is a museum where they can find the most important sculptures and pictures of Antonio Canovas and , Bernini , who stayed for a long time working in Rome .
CONCLUSION
I would recommend them the buildings because :
1 ) First of all , there are sited in the center of Rome so , they can take a bus to get them move and around the city .
2 ) Secondly , they can enjoy visiting museums , and afterwards they can take something to eat or to drink in the " pizzerias ' and restaurants near these famous places .
In conclusion , they could combine art , the history and the night visiting one only place without spend much money .
Dear Marie ,
I am sorry to hear that our friend Mr Brown is ill .
As our conference is due to start next week I respond straight away .
There are some informations you have asked me about .
We booked rooms for your group at the Palace Hotel .
That is the best option because it is placed less than 5 minutes walk from the Conference Center .
When you live a hotel you have to turn right and you bloun the street .
At the first traffic lights turn right again and you should see a big blue building .
That 's our Conference Center .
At the hotel reception you will find printed information how to get over there .
As you know at the end - of - conference there is a party .
Party is due to start at 8 p.m until 3 a.m. There is 2hr break between end - of - conference and party .
At this time you and your group can refresh yourself .
Hope you will enjoy it .
We prepared some special attraction like live dance music and hot or cold buffet .
About you 're the last question I can sugest to visit the Royal Castle .
Your sincerely ,
In our town there is so many interesting places to see that there is hard to choose one .
In my opinion the most interesting is the Castle .
It is placed on a hill so it is very easy to recognize when is it .
Just look up and you will see that huge building .
Actually it is a whole complex , the Old and the New Castle , Cathedrall and the most interesting undergroud part with it 's amazing crypts .
And if you climb on the top of the main tower - the keep you will see unforgetable view on a white toun .
After that you can explore our great museum at the Old Castle .
You will find there an amazing collection of old weapon , armores and , we are especially pround of it , the great collection of swords .
After that I am sure you will be happy to find a few restaurands located at the New Castle .
I am sure that should be enought for one day trip .
For you information I can say that at this time we have five weeks festival and this night there will be a great display .
That should complete that amazing day .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am writing this letter in reply to your letter which arrived yesterday .
I do welcome you and your group , and I am willing to help you by giving the informations that you have asked me .
Firstly , let me explain the way from the PALACE HOTEL , where your group will be staying , to the conference .
The hotel is located in the centre of Seoul , therefore there many ways to get to the conference .
The easiest way to get there is to take the underground , which takes about 20 minutes .
The map will be given to you on the day of your arrival .
Secondly , the end - of - conference party will be held in the Palace Hotel 's Percel Room and starts at 6 o'clock in the evening .
Professor Kim from my college is going to give a speech , and after that dinner will be served .
The party is not very formal , so you can wear any kind of dress , as long as it is suitable for dinner .
Finally , I would like you to recommend the visit to a traditional Korean palace Kyong Bok for the last day 's free time .
It must be a very interesting visit for the students who has never experienced an oriental atmosphere .
It is just 5 minutes walk from the hotel , and in front of the hotel gate , an airport bus will be waiting for you to take you to the airport after finishing the outing .
I hope you will enjoy your stay in Korea , and do not hesitate to contact me for any further information .

Report on Kyoung Bok Palace - the Glory of Chosun Kingdom .
.
Introduction .
This report provides the information about Kyong Bok Palace , which is highly recommended to visit for visitors from foreign countries .
It highlights the background history and considers the interest of young peoples , and makes a final recommendation .
.
History .
The kingdom Chosun has a history for 500 years and lasted until the beginning of 20th century .
Kyong Bok Palace was the main residence of the royal family , so you will be able to imagine its size .
As the kings of Chosun loved to be a part of the nature , the palace had a huge garden , however it was destroyed by the army of Japan , and now there remains only a part of the original palace .
There is a special monument for the last queen of Chosun who was killed by the Japanese army .
.
Activity .
The reason that this palace is also popular for the youngsters , who tends to dislike the historical visit , would be the various activity .
You can try the traditional games of Korea and there is a chance to wear the traditional clothes of the Royals .
Also there are performances which helds daily in the front gate of the palace .
.
Final Recommendation .
It is out of question not to visit Kyong Bok Palace unless you do not want to know about Korean history .
You will find many interesting points there , therefore , I urge you to visit the place , if you want to experience the tradition of Korea .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am writing in response to your letter where you asked me to give you more information about international student conference and give some ideas and suggestions of what you and your students can do during your free time here .
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is located in the central area of the city , so it will not take you and your students too much time to get to the town hall where the conference is supposed to be progressed .
The easiest way to get there from your hotel is to take buses 461 or 176 ( the bus stop is opposite to the hotel ) or we can hire a minibus for you but there is an extra charge for it .
There is a party on the last day of the conference .
Special awards will be given to the students whose reports are the best .
Less of the party is likely to be as our night club so a lots of music , dancing and fun are provided .
Please note that the alchocholich drinks are only sold untill 11 pm .
You can wear whatever you like for this kind of party .
Coming back to ideas and Suggestions I'v promised to give you about free afternoon befor you catch your plane I can advise you to visit our zoo or to for a picnik in a park befor you will go to the night party .
Yours sincerely ,
Can you see how many inventions you are surrounded with in your life ?
Such a simple and usuall things like a telefone , a car , a computer so only seem to be normal and usuall for us ( or we have got used ) as we use them every day .
Hundred years before people could n't even use an electric lump not saying about a car or computer .
They have intentions improved our life a lot since they had appeared , but not every one beleives it is really so .
Some people say that many of important inventions in our live are not so good and useful as we have got used to see them .
First of all they say about enviroment pollution which cars and other vechicles make , overspending the electricity using electric equipment and some others .
But to my opinion if peoples inventions take a place in our lifes they are right then .
I think the telefone is the most important thing in many people 's lifes as it makes you to be able to get in touch with anyone does n't matter wherever you are ( I am talking about mobile phones which now have a majority of our choice ) .
Computers make everything much faster so everything is now based on computer systems .
An electric lamp was an important invention hundred years before ( but for that time it was like a revolution ) .
I think it would n't be possible to survive for us without an eclectric life .
Because of shipbuilding development people could make all the geographical discoveries , and an automobile transport is undenyable neccecerity in our life .
In case of all said I am more likely to think that the benefits of advantages of peopel 's inventions are much higre the all their disadvantages .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I have just read your letter and I am happy to help with giving you some further information .
According to your first question , for the time of conference the students will be staying at the Palace Hotel , where the reservation has been already made .
It is situated near to our college , about five minutes walk from the nearest tube station , which is South Wimbledon .
As you were informed , there will be a party for all attendants of the conference , which will take place afterwards at the hotel restaurant .
Minding the fact that it will be entirely sociable meeting I believe that casual clothes are the most suitable option for this event .
Finally , answering your last question about student 's day - out , I suggest visiting a local Lawn tennis Museums and Wimbledon Tennis Courts as it is one of the best international tourists attractions .
If you have any further questione , please do not hesitate to contact me .
I look forward to seeing you .
Yours sincerely ,

Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
Thank you for your letter .
I am writing to give you some advice of an international student conference .
First of all , the name of hotel which we have been booked into is Palace Hotel .
And we have two choices to get to the conference , a bus or a train .
Both of them are as convinience as getting there .
The day before we will leave there , we have a party which takes place in our hotel .
It is a kind of formal party , so we should be well - dressed .
I suggest that you wear a formal dress .
There is some finger foods and drinks .
It might be a great party for end of conference .
End of all , in my opinion we could go a center of the town because there is many places to have a look and go shopping .
It 's quite a nice and a suitable place to spend for three hours .
It could be interesting for them .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Imagine our life without a telephone .
If a telephone haven't been invented , we would n't have lived perfectly like nowadays .
Would n't you think we rely on it more than we expect ?
A telephone is used when we need to contact with someone , and also an emergency situation and an internet .
It has various way to use , however , nowadays it is not only used by these purpose , but also it keeps our company .
Even if you feel alone , you can talk and hear from your friend easily .
Then it makes you happy .
Long time ago people lived without this perfect invention .
But how ?
They used to keep in touch with someone with a letter .
In spite of taking a lot of time to catch up with , it was a only way .
So that 's why they have invented a telephon .
Now we could feel the world closer and closer beaus of a telephone .
Who would n't thank for this great invention ?
Dear Madam ,
I received your letter and I 'm pleased to answer your questions .
M. Brown has booked rooms in the Palace Hotel .
This is a first class hotel .
The easiest way from the hotel to the conference is with the bus .
There is a bus stop in front of your hotel .
Take the bus in direction center town .
After four stops get off the bus .
The name of this bus stop is ' Kongresshaus ' .
If you leave the bus , the conference is in the house opposite the road .
You ca n't miss it .
Afterwards we will eat together in a restaurant and we will go in a disco .
For the disco you musn't wear blue jeans .
Finally at your last day I propose you to do a sightseeing tour in our town .
It takes you two hours .
Afterwards you will have any time to buy some souvenirs from Switzerland .
If you have any more questions , write me back .
Yours sincerely ,
I will write about the invention of the computer .
With the computer our work is easier and more interesting .
Before the time with computers , people had to write every time a whole letter .
When they would correct a word , they had to write the whole letter again .
With the computer we can write a letter , correct a word or change the name without writting the whole letter again . We save the letter and in three week we could send it to another person .
I work at a bank and I work all day with computers .
If we hand't ay one , we had to write all the transactions on papers .
If I order money for our bank with the computer I can be sure that I will arrive the day after .
But if I had to write a letter and to send it by post , the money will arrive two or three days after .
I have never work without a computer , but if we had n't any we would it find normally .
Mrs Maria Smith ,
I 'm pleased to be able to help you for the international student conference .
The hotel in which the group has been booked to is the Palace hotel , which is situated near the big bridge of Mont Blanc .
To get from the hotel to the conference , you have to take the highway indirection of Lausanne , and after nearly half an hour of driving you come out at the place which is indicated with Coppet , Divonne .
When you come out , just go on your right , and then turn left to follow the indications to the Châtaigneroie school .
The end - of - conference party will take place at the same place .
Some musicians will play classical music , and there will be many different drinks and food .
you should wear some formal clothes , but not necessary really pretty clothes
For three hours , you could visit the museum of the Red Cross , which is very interesting .
I hope that these informations will help you
Sincerely yours ,
The portable phone , a very useful invention !
During all mankind history , there were discovers who tried to make human life better , but it is in the last century that there were the most biggest discoveries made .
When the phone without cable was invented , one was n't sure if it would be a success or not .
But the research went on , and the portable phone is getting always smaller and more useful .
The portable phone is an important invention , because nearly everybody has one , and so one can always call somebody if there is a problem .
Moreover , some portable phones have a connection to the web , so it is easy to read newspapers if one hasn't enough money to buy it .
Personally , the portable phone has affected my own life , because when somebody is phoning at home , I do n't have to rush to take the phone , being afraid that it 's too late .
I recommend this extremely important invention to those who still do n't have a portable phone .
Dear Maria ,
I would be pleased to help you about all your questions and I will provide you some information which you need as much as I can .
I would like to inform you that Centeral Red Lion Hotel has been booked for the accomadation of the group and it will be quite easy to get every where from the hotel on foot during your stay .
As you know that we arrange an evening party on the third day of the week , we can say that a kind of relaxation time .
Nothing will be spacial .
Place is College garden .
Time is 7 pm .
There is no need to bother about clouths .
Everybody can put on something casual .
Befor leav from England I suggest you to visit the cannals and small villages around Basingstoke . You could find the opportunaty to see the country life .
Yours sincerely ,
Time flies
I have to admit that whoever invented the cars and transportation vehicles did the most respectable invention of the word .
I say that it must be the most important thing for us because they save our times passing so fast .
Can you deny how quickly we get somewhere by car or by bus .
May be 10 times as quick as getting somewhere on foot .
Try to imagine your life without having anyof them .
Would n't be unbarable and painful .
Ceartainly it would be just like mine .
Because I live in a rural area far from any village , town , or city center .
The nearest civilization takes me 1 hour on foot .
I have no car , no local bus service to use .
Even comeing to Basingstoke seems like a international journey to me .
And ofcause this stops me everytime to live sociable life .
But also I 'm aware of that the time flies for me . I must do whatever I want befor it is too late .
And I have to confess the invention of the car was the most usefull invention for the humanity .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
I was delighted to receive your letter and to know that a group of students from your college have decided to take a part in our international student conference .
As you need more information , I answer all your questions with plesuare .
Firstly , the Palace Hotel has been booked for your group .
It is one of the most comfortable hotels in our sity and situated only half a mile from main building of our college , so it is very simple to get from there to the conference by foot .
Secondly , our end - of - conference party is included dinner and dancing , I would advise you to wear something not very formal .
Finally , you can spend an afternoon on the last day visiting local historical places ( castles , builded in 13-th century ) or art gallery , as well as beatiful Bodnant garden .
I am looking forward to the meeting with you and mutual work during conference .
Your sincerely
There are many different people 's inventions around us .
We are so used to them , that sometimes think they existed always .
Some of them are very practical , other are rather strange .
I thing , that one of the most importent and affecting our life inventions is the telephone .
Imagine life without phone .
You are on the road , you have car accident .
What are you going to do without phone ?
On another situation , your son is ill , he needs help urgently .
I am sure , the phone has saved many lifes .
Besides , it is always very nice to ring your friend or mum , only for chating in any time .
Thanks the phone , it is possible even your mam is on the other end of the Earth .
To be honest , next great invention of people , computer , ca n't work , if you haven't got the phone .
So I am very grateful to man , who invented it , unfornutely , I have forgotten his name .
It always happens with people , does n't ?
Try to ask who invented the will or the book .
Chêne - Bourg , Tuesday 12th June .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
it is with great regret that I hear of Mr Brown 's illness , and hope to see him soon in an excellent health .
Nevertheless , I am both pleased and honoured to expect you and your group in the context of our international meeting .
We have made arrangements for you to stay at the Palace Hotel .
Furthermore , since it is located between the airport and our location , a bus shuttle has been organised to pick all our guests from the hotel to the conference room .
The end - of - conference party is to be held at the ' Royal Room ' of the hotel , which has an outstanding reputation for its quality and seriousness .
Therefore , all guests will be asked to wear the corresponding clothes in order to be accepted .
As for the three hours of free time , I strongly suggest you to check - in your lugages at the airport and then , after a five - minutes bus ride , spend your time in the marvellous ' Old City ' .
Best Regards ,
My fair Mobile Phone .
The technological revolution taking place today can be directly linked to the amazing evolution of our communication abilities throughout those last years .
The inevitable invention symbolizing this aspect in our ordinary life is , of course , the mobile phone .
It is clear and irrefutable that the use of this invention has becomed a necessary condition in some professional activities .
Trades , politicians and taxi drivers are but a few examples of such needs .
However , the common man seems to ignore how important and useful a mobile phone becomes , when in the hands of a high - school student .
It becomes then a real obsession for the average students , as e uses it before the lessons , during the lessons , during lunch and , especially , during examinations ...
Nevertheless , it is also a common mistake to believe that the sole purpose of such an usage is to communicate information during an exam , since its major role is actually to allow the student and the parents to discuss during everyday 's courses .
Bottom line is that any teacher complaining about this situation should confiscate not the student 's phone , but his parents ' !
Dear Mrs. Smith ,
I have just received the letter from you and I 'm writting to you as soon as posible .
I can promise to you that I 'll do my best to help you .
You told me that you are the leader of a group of students this year , because Mr. Brown is ill .
Poor Mr. Brown , I hope he will get better soon .
As I 've just checked the group has been booked into The Palace Hotel .
The best way to get from there to the conference is by coache , that I have arranged for you .
The driver Mr. Olsson works for us since .
He will pick you up at 11 oo a.m. The conference is from 12 oo to 2 oo p.m. At the end of conference is a party from 2 oo to 3 oo .
I suggest you to wear comfortable and nice clothes because I have planed a sightseeing for you before your plane at 8 oo p.m. I 'd like to show you a museum , a gallery and the gardens that are belonging to the palace .
Then we can have a rest in the caffee and talk before your flight home .
I think I gave you all importen informations .
I hope to see you all soon ,
Yours sincerely ,
Nowdays motorization is one of the most important inventions .
As you look amoung everybody has a car or motorcycle .
No matter that people started worred more about polution in the world .
Let me to tell you , how invention of motorcycle has affected my life .
I love motocycles and I do n't think I could live without them .
I drive motocycle since I was 16 year old .
Me and my brother we used to go to the rock concerts .
We have met a lot of people there same mad about motorcycle as we were .
We were avenging races and trips .
We were driving motocycles few day befour we finally had got to mitting points .
I really enjoy driving motocycle .
People say that is dangerous , I do n't think so .
When I drive is only me and my motocycle .
Before me and after are my friends that I like and trust .
And around me nature that I can watch and enjoy while we shop fore camp .
We can go to any place we like , avoid traffic and to full buses , trains , etc .
I am really greatful for people who invented the first motocycle in the world .
I feel very bad about that I do n't know who was it .
On the other hand no matter that I feel very good about that because that invention has changed and affected my life end people I care about , has affected my life in a very best way .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
Thank you very much for your letter .
As you asked me in the letter , I am very happy to help you with finding out details of the conference .
The hotel that your group will be staying at is Palace Hotel .
It is reasonably near to the college , so it may be very good to walk from the hotel along River Thames following yellow signs on sunny days .
If it rains , you can take bus 54 that stops in front of the college .
The end - of - conference party is designed to give rough ideas about many different cultures .
So you will enjoy traditional foods , music , dances and games from all over the world .
As a part of this , the leader of each group has to wear a costume of her country .
Other members of groups can wear a normal pretty formal dress .
On the last day , I recommend that you will visit the place that is located at the centre of our city .
It is about 1000 years old , so I am sure that you will find it fascinating to see it .
Yours sincerely ,
Can you imagine your life without any computers at all ?
Well , I am sure that you can hardly do this unless you are living deep in a forest or in a dessert !
If you think about how many computers we use every day and how dependent we are on them , it must be clear that invention of computers has certainly had a significant impact on all our lives .
For example , all infrastructures such as transports and power stations are ran using computers government uses them to organise all sorts of things in a country , and all kids of services and businesses such as hospitals and supermarkets use them as essential capitals .
In other words , almost all aspects of our lives today rely on computers .
From my personal experience , I can also say that a personal computer is also an amazing tool .
It improves productivity of my homework , that is often essay writing , and also it allows me to access to the internet .
Since I live abroad , the internet is really useful for me to have a contact with my bestfriend and to know what is going on in my home country .
To sum up , I can say that the greatest ever invention is the invention of computers that has affected both indivisuals and a society as a whole .
Dear Mrs. Smith ,
I am writing in reply to your enquiry about this year international conference .
The conference will be held at The Palace Hotel on Old Street .
There will be signs to follow from Central train station .
The conference is commensing on 31st June 2001 from 10.00 - 15.00 .
Light lunch will be provided .
After the conference , there will be a relaxing party .
There is no dressed - code for the party .
However I suggest you could wear the same outfit as you wear for the conference .
I have included the local map , there are some ideas at the back of the map .
Please let me know if you would like to book one of the city - walk tours , We have arrange spacial discounts for the conference attendance .
Personly I recommend the Dicken 's tour because it is a good length of walking and very historical .
I hope that I have covered all information you would need and look forward to seeing you .
Your sincerely ,
P.S. Please find the enclosed map .
There are several interesting buildings in the city of London .
I believe Liverpool Street Station is at the top list .
The building itself looks grand and elegant .
Despite the fact that this building has served half - a million commuters in a day , it always clean and functional .
There are two parts of Liverpool Street Station that make it so interesting building .
The newly decorated section is fairly modern style with escalators and touched - screen ticket machine .
It is also very well linked into the old underground station which it is such a contrast in transformation .
The old bit is rather unique and charming .
You could really imagine how it looked like in the old day .
There is another surprising section in this building .
At the far back of the station is also connected to a spacious well designed pedestrians park .
It is a good example of a great architecture that was designed to provide services to the public .
Finally , it is in the heart of city and everyone would be able to find without doubt .
12 June 2001
Dear Mrs Smith
Thank you for your letter dated 8 June 2001 .
I hope I can give you the information you need .
So the conference will be a great experience to you and your group .
Your group will stay at the Palace Hotel .
The Palace Hotel is situated in the town centre next to the railway station .
A free shuttel - bus gets you to the conference - center .
The bus leavs at 8 a.m. at the front entrance of the hotel .
The end - of - conference party is playing in a rent and in the greenground .
There will be a barbecue , a place to dance and many more .
It is a surprice !
I suggest to wear leisure - clothes to the party .
The last afternoon you could go on a city - tour , visite the museum of Fine Arts or enjoy the beautiful flower garden next to the common park .
I hope I could give you some ideas . I look forward to seeing you .
Yours sincerely ,
What would life be without the phone ?
Have you ever thought about a world without phone ?
How was it in the 18 century with no opportunity to communicate by phone and how would it be now ?
I can not imagine how our life would be .
We are living in a busy world .
In the business world you use the phone all the time to speak with your clients , to make appointments , to order an article e.c . ; then , time is money !
How has the phone affected my own life ? I think , that is a good question to think about . I could not call my friends from an other city and just say " hello " .
It would be difficult and take more time to make an appointment .
So , what did the phone - revolution for us ?
It saves time .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I 'm writing in reply to your letter in which you asked me for help .
I hope I will be able to give you the information you need for the group of students who are coming to the conference .
Firstly , the Palace Hotel is waiting for you and your students .
The best way to get from there to the college where the conference will take place is simply to walk .
Actually , the college is situated 500 meters away from the Hotel .
As you know , the conference will be followed by a party .
It will begin at 7 p.m and last until late in the evening .
You do n't need to worry about what you should wear to this event .
In fact , the purpose of the end - of - conference party is to relax after a busy day , therefore you and your students can put jeans and sport shoes on .
To conclude , we decided to organize a guided tour by coach , as you have an afternoon free before your plane takes off .
I hope the international student conference will help to know each other better and that it will be a success .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I 'm writing in reply to your letter in which you asked me information on an interesting building to visit .
There is so many places of interest in Lausanne , but I think that the Olympic Museum is the most notable for the following reasons :
The Olympic Museum dates from the 19th century and is the biggest in Europe .
It shows all the different sports men have been doing since the first Olympic Games in Greece .
You can see the evolution of sports and understand why changes gradually have been done to improve them .
You can admire every kind of equipments you need to do any particular sport .
You will be informed about the story of sport in general and about the new technologies which are used nowaday n high competitions .
The museum is near the city center and is accessible by bus or walking .
It will takes you an afternoon to visit it and then you can enjoy a drink or a meal in the restaurant on the third floor , well - known for being one of the best establishment in Lausanne .
I hope my recommendations will help you in the choice of a building to visit .
Yours faithfully ,
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I 'm writing in response to the letter we have received from you , in order to let you know all the information you have asked for .
First of all , your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , Main - Road 21 , which is situated not far from our college .
I 'd suggest you to walk , it will only take you about seven minutes .
Just follow Main - Road until to reach a junction , where you turn right and then walk along Denl - a - Lion Road .
The college is a huge , yellow building - you ca n't miss it .
Secondly , you have required information about the end - of - conference party .
It will begin at 6 o'clock p.m. and last until midnight .
All the students will be provided with sacks and we have managed to book a band as well .
The location of the party is n't fixed yet , but we will let you know after your arrival .
There is no need putting on special clothes for the party , casual ones should do it as well , for we want everyone to feel comfortable .
Last but not least I will give you some ideas of where to spend your free afternoon .
I 'd suggest you to visit our local museum , as there is a marvellous exhibition there at the moment .
Provided the weather is fine , you could also go swimming or make a tour through our beautiful town .
( I could book a guide for you if you 're interested )
Please write back or call me if there is any more information you need .
I 'm looking forward to meeting you and wish you all the best .
Yours sincerely ,
The telephone , a blessing .
Who of you could imagine life without the telephone ?
Not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in for a moment ?
Not being able to lie to your mother - in - law and pretend you ca n't attend her garden party because of an illness , without having to look her in the eye ?
When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone , he had no idea of how popular it would be one day .
Its first appliance was in order to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person .
Nowadays , however , the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one could imagine life without it .
Take me , for example , I use it whenever there is a problem and I need some advice , or when I have to call off a meeting for any reason .
I can not always walk to the person and say " Sorry , I must cancel our meeting " , because then it 's too late anyway , is n't it ?
Life definitely would n't be the same without the invention of the telephone .
We use it daily in order to get information or to pass it on .
Just try to spend one week without using a telephone at all , and you will see that it is impossible to do so .
So do n't take the telephone for granted , but keep in mind that our modern way of life is mainly due to its invention .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I would like to thank you for your letter .
I am sorry to learn that Richard Brown can not attend the conference .
Please transmit him my best wishes for his recovery .
We have booked rooms for all members of your group at the Palace Hotel .
It is a very cosy building that is on the same avenue as the conference building , approximetively one mile away .
There is a direct bus link between the two locations : this is bus line number six ; the bus station for the conference building is called " Avenue de cour " and the one at the Palace Hotel is named " Main station " .
Concerning the party we do not have a casual dressing code .
students usually wear dark clothes with a tie for the boys and a mid - long skirt or dress for the girls .
There are a lot of activities you can do during your free afternoon .
I would like to suggest visiting the " Ethnographic Museum , , which is kind of unique in the world .
Looking forward to meeting you soon
I remain , yours sincerely .
The car :
I think that the car is one of the human inventions that has the most affected the way of life of people from industrial countries .
Nowadays more than the percents of the world industry is related to the automotive business : car manufacturing , gasoline extracting and refining , tyres recycling , and so on .
The industrial countries have encountered deep evolution of their strictures since the car has been made available to everyone .
At the beginning of the last Century only a few very rich people could afford a car ; it was kind of leisure or sport to drive one .
Today almost everyone owns a car and needs it for daily activities .
The transport network has changed according to this social evolution .
The increasing number of cars related and infrastructure are now creeting problems .
A lot of roads and motorways are overcrowded , and enviromment issues are more and more related to the intensive use of cars and lorries .
People and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the enviromment without impacting their mobility .
This will be a tough challenge for this new century .
Dear Mrs Smith :
My name is Juniper , I am helping to organise the conference in the college .
I received your letter the other day and I am writing to answer your questions .
The group has been booked into Palace Hotel which is not very far from the place where the conference will be held .
You can take the No.41 bus from the hotel to the conference , it only takes ten minutes approximately .
As for the end - of - conference party , it will be on the morning of the last day starting at 9:00 .
All the students and staffs will join together in the hall .
They can play games and talk about personal experience .
The main aim of it is to deepen the friendship among all these pupils coming from all over the world .
So it would be fine if you wear casual clothes and look smart .
I have made arrangement for the afternoon on the last day for you .
If you are free I will show you arround our college .
You can visit our newly - built science lab as well .
I 'm sure you would acquire a lot of knowledge there .
I 'm looking forward to meeting you .
Best wishes .
Best choice
Welcome to London .
You asked me for an interesting building to visit .
In my opinion , I 'll recommend British Museum .
One of the reasons is you can learn almost everything about British history there .
The museum looks very old as some other buildings in London , but it is very modern inside .
After going through the enormous main door , you can see a huge white round building which is a library .
A lot of famous people have been to this library before !
The British Hall is on the first floor , not far from the library .
It shows a large number of valuable things .
Almost each one tells you a story or gives you a picture about British history .
Apart from the national history , there are more content about the past of the world .
You can go to many sections such as Asia Hall , Egypt Hall , Europe Hall and so on .
Countless fascinating things will definely take you the whole day to appreciate .
After a visit to British Museum , you will be certainly able to put your history textbook away !
Also you do n't have to pay any money for it , and the transport is extremely convenient , therefore British Museum is your best choice . Do n't be hesitant any more !

We organized a end - of - conference party on the day before your departure .

The Most Important Invention
I love baking cakes , cockies and breads .
Baking is passion and in the town I live I 'm known for making the best cakes in the area .
It does n't matter in what kind of mood I am , I can do it all the time and it makes me feel good .
But I could n't bake without an oven .
I 'm so grateful for this invention which allows me to live my passion .
I think the oven is one of the most important inventions .
If there is someone who does n't agree with me , he or she should try to live one month without using the oven .
Besides that he or she should look carefully into what he or she buys .
I 'm positive that after such an experience everyone says that the oven is a really important invention for our lifes .
I 'm thanking the person who invented the oven .
Thank you !
Dear Mrs. Smith ,
I am writing in reply to your letter .
I am sorry about Richard Brown .
And I understand that you need help , so that I will help you as far as I can .
Firstly , the hotel which ha been booked for you is Palace Hotel that is located close to the conference .
In order to get from the hotel to the conference , you just need to take the bus we will offer .
Secondly , the end - of - conference party will take place in the same hall as the conference at 6 p.m. , which includes dinner and an announcement by the president of the conference .
The party is arranged as a casual party , therefore , you can wear comfortable clothes . You can expect to meet many students from other schools as well .
Finally , if you want to have an exciting experience in here , I strongly suggest that you go to the musicals .
As you may hear , our city is well known for the musicals .
Or , If you want to relax , you can take a walk in the park situated in ten minutes distance on foot from the hotel .
Whatever you choose , you will be satisfied with your choice .
If you have more questions about the conference and something else , do not hesitate to ask me . I would be glad to be able to help you .
Yours sincerely ,
Some inventions are not regarded as great things even though the life without them can not be imagined .
However , there is something which is still believed that it was an extreamly important invention .
This is electricity invented by Edison .
From my point of view , the reason why electricity is such an important invention is that most of machines , appliances and equipments which are used in modern times can be operated with only electricity , which makes people not to too much phisical labour .
What is more , many inventions have been accelerated by electricity .
In my life , I use electricity in many different ways .
At night , I can study because of it . and also It saves my time which would be used up for doing housework such as laundry , cleaning rooms and ironing .
It makes my life more convenient than that without it .
To sum up , although people do not feel that electricity is a great invention any more , the fact that electricity is one of the most important inventions in the world will not be changed .

Please , if you have any more question , please call me at 38755980 .
Yours sincerely ,
I can live without this .
It 's true .
In our lifes , may be , could n't be without electricity .
Some people can live without this , but I am sure that the world would be very different .
When we are using different equipments in our houses , we are using the electricity .
Small things but very importants in our lifes .
For example : T.V. , computer , just light and a long list that now I can not write .
I do n't like tinking , my house of my life , without all this facilities .
In winter when is dark very early , and after , I need to spent my free time in home .
What I can do without my music and my computer .
Now , just you need to think that you would do or what would happen in a city , with a car , aeroplans , shoops , all these things without lights .
Finally . I think that everybody know that the electricity is very important invent and for me it is the best .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
Thanks for your last letter and I am sorry for not giving you enough information .
We have already booked a 4 stars hotel - Palace Hotel , which is near the River Thames , in Walton - on - Thames .
It is not far away from the station so we will go there by train .
The end - of - conference party will be held in an India restaurant , that is next to the hotel .
It is surposed to be held during 7 pm to 11 pm .
Also there are some competitions and exciting games after dinner and disco is also provided .
You can wear anything you like , we would like you to be just yourself and have fun .
As you know , our area is quite famous and lots of people come and visit it every year .
There are so many things to do , unfortunately , there is just 3 hours .
I recommend the high street in the centre of our area because it is quite good for shopping .
So you can buy gifts for your friends or families .
I hope I have given you enough information and if you still have some doubts , please do not hestitate to contact us .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Nowadays , our lives is becoming better and better .
Lots of great inventions has been invented in order to make people live comfortablely .
If you ask me which is the greatest invention of all , I will say that it is the television .
" Televisions is just an amazing invention . " My good friend said that . I agree with her .
Firstly , televisions make us know more about the world without travel it all .
If there are no televisions , we wo n't know what are the other countries like , or even what language they speak unless we go to that country .
Secondly , for some points , it can educate young children .
Many TV programmes are especially made for children , such as " Learn follow me " and " Be good to others " .
Actually , they are quite good programmes and helped me know what I should do generally or how to behave nicely when I was still a child .
The last but not least , it is a good kind of entertainments .
Maybe you will think that playing basketball , going to cinemas and discos are much better that staying at home sitting in front of an object .
However , televisions can bring you the fun that other activities ca n't .
If sometimes I do n't want to go out and I do n't want to be lonely , that 's easy , just turn on the television and enjoy myself .
However , everything has its advantages and disadvantages .
Personally , I do think televisions is the most important invention .
Dear Mrs. Maria Smith .
I got your letter this morning and I am very pleased to give you some information .
As I know , he booked the Palace Hotel in downtown .
When you go to the conference , you can take a bus or a taxi .
But if you have enough time , I would like to recommend to walk .
Because there are a lot of beatiful trees and you can see the sea .
And also it takes just fifteen minutes .
I think everybody can enjoy it .
By the way the end - of - conference party is a kind of fairwell party .
There will be three parts .
The first part , the chairman and a few guests will have a speech and the second part , the participacients will evaluate themselves , and the the last part it will provide dinner and drinks .
It will be not too formal party .
So you can wear what you like .
Moreover , I would like to recommend ' City tour ' for three hours .
Everybody an enjoy themselves .
It is £ 12 each and there is a reduction for groups .
I hope it will be a good tip for you and if you have any problem , you can contact with me any time .
And have a nice time in my town and send my regard to Richard .
Yours sincerely ,
Nowadays there are a lot of inventions around the world , and they make us more comfortable and convenient .
Moreover we can not live without them .
For example : electricity , computer , telephon , boat , and car ( wheel ) , etc .
None of them are unimportant for us .
But I think the invention of electricity is the most important thing among them .
If you look around at home , there are a lot of electric things .
Electricity could be able to invent other things .
It also gave us more free time , especially for women .
It has abosolutly reduced women 's our house working time .
Evenmore we can enjoy our night with lights .
If we want do something , we can do it at night same as day .
Finally the quality of our life is changed by electricity .
It is also advancing more and more .
It will give us better future !
Have you ever imagined that you would drive electric car !

Story
It is 500 years old , and it is said to be haunted by a lady ghost .

Dear group leader ,
Welcome to Taiwan .
This report is based on an interesting building , where you can take , for your students to visit .
This building is situated in Taipei , the capital .
The building is called Chiang Kei - shek Momerial Hall .
Nearly everyone knows where this building is , so if you have a chance , just ask the local people in Taipei about this building .
The momerial Hall is surrounded by large playgrounds .
As you go into the main Hall , you will see a huge statue of Chiang Kei - shek , this is because the building is the rememberence of how well Chiang did in History .
The statue is about 20 feet high .
Next to the statue is protected by the guards , the guards will change every four hours .
Apart from the main Hall , there are also lots of other gallaries .
In these gallaries there are Historical paintings , antique furnitures which Chiang used .
These treasure are very old , even older than the history of America .
They are all been well look after .
As well as all the treasures , statue and historical paintings ...
There are also restaurent 's and modern gallaries .
When you are tired after looking around you might want to buy drinks or something to eat , or if you are fed up with historical thing , you migh as well just pop into the modern gallery to see things which are more modern .
Finally , if you went to visit this building I will recommend you to stay at a hotel not far from the momerial Hall called Hyatt Hotel .
It only take about five minutes if you walk .
I hope you will all have a great time in Taiwan and I hope you will enjoy the building .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I have received your letter dated on the 12th june 2001 .
I am very happy to help you and I hope that the informations , that I am going to give you , will be enough .
The international student conference will be in the Palace Hotel in Lausanne .
The Hotel is a big building in the middle of the town near the place " St - François " .
And the name of the street is " Grand - Chêne " .
You can not miss it .
After the conference , we are going to stay in the Palace Hotel but instead to stay in the conference room , we are going to move to the reception room where a dinner will be prepared for us .
Afterwards , a live band are going to play the rest of the night .
For the clothes , you have to wear something smart and classic .
If you want to stay in Lausanne during your afternoon free , the best thing to do is to go to Ouchy .

OLYMPIQUE MUSEUM
The aim of this report is to give further informations on an interesting building to visit in Lausanne .
It is based on my own experience .
WHY THE OLYMPIC MUSEUM .
The Olympique Museum is situated near the lake and offer , for the tourist , an unbelievable view on the mountains and the lake .
But also , the museum have a lot of gardens with several statues .
Besides , the architecture of the building is beautiful and very modern .
First of all , the main interest of the museum is the olympic history .
You can find a lot of documentary about it and you have several competitors personal objects .
In addition , you can play with several interactive game and learn about the rules of the olympic games .
REASONS OF RECOMMENDATION .
The principal reason is the cheapest price .
You pay only to FRS for the entry and you can stay in all the time that you want .
On the other hand , if you are more than 10 people , you can have a group price and pay only 6 Frs per person .
It seems that this solution might be the best way to visit this museum .
CONCLUSION .
To sum up , the Olympic Museum is a very attractive place and could be a good trip with your family or your student group .
Therefore , if you want to learn something about the Olympic Games , it must be the best place for this .
Dear Maria ,
I 'm so happy to help you for this international student conference .
I 'm afraid for Richard .
Could you please tell him my best wishes of health ?
I 'm sure you can perfectly replace it to lead your group .
At first , you should know that you are booked into the Palace Hotel that is one of the best in the town .
The access to the conference place is very easy .
First of all , you must walk down to the Central Street until you arrive at the bus stop , then you take the bus number two that goes directly to the college .
After the conference , there is a great party that is organised by friends .
It starts at twenty o'clock until the end of the night , so be ready !
There is no special thema for the wearing style but it should be more fun if you wear something crazy ...
Finally , I propose you to go to the new college swimmingpool on the last day afternoon .
Every body will go there .
I hope you will have fun !
Yours sincerely
Hello ,
I will give you some informations on the yverdon 's castle .
This building is one of the oldest that stays in the landscape of the town .
I think its important to see it when you come there because it shows us how the town had been developped around it since its creation .
Those days , the castle is being remade , so there is a lot of construction engines around it .
That 's not a big problem because there is a complete museum in it where you can see old pictures of the castle during the centuries .
There is a lot of old items that were in the King 's family .
You should have probably heard about the mummy who sleeps there for about two thousand years ... You can see it in the dungeon .
So you can visit everywhere you want with or without a guide .
I hope you will enjoy the visit and I wish you a nice holliday in Yverdon .
Best regards ,
Dear Mrs Smith ,
Thank you for your letter .
I will try my best to answer the questions .
First of all , we have already booked the Five - Stars Hotel for your group .
It is a modern hotel , near our college , and it is also very convenent to come from the airport . You can take both by buses or taxies .
The nember 101 bus starts from the airport , than you can get off from " city college " stop .
It would be a great chance to tark part in the party for everyone .
This is just a relaxing party , just for the members have a chance to relax and make friends .
So I think you 'd better to wear a dress .
Finally , about the free three hours , my personal prefer to go shopping .
Our city has got the biggest shoping centre in South England , there gathers so many shops .
It worthes tp spend time and money on that .
I look forward to seeing you !
Yours sincerely
Nowdays people have become used to watching televesion 's programs everyday .
The TV is so important that you can see it in every family , and it is a essential equipment for everyone .
First of al , in my opinion , TV has a great education functions , and also makes the world become small .
You can just sit at home then you can know what is happening all over the world at the moment .
I would rather watching the news on TV in stead of reading in newspaper or hearing on radio because the news on TV are vivid .
Moreover , the TV is a great company for the people who live alone or feel alone . I would like to open TV when I stay at home .
Someone are talking , laughting , crying on there , so join them , you will feel much better than just yourself .
Some TV programs are enjouable !
However , TV also has some disadvantages .
You might just sitting in front of TV for hours learn nothing , or no more talk with your family .
I think this is the badest influence in the society .
In clucsion , the TV has both advantages and disagvangtages , but on the whole advantages is greater than disadvantages .
So , but on the whole , TV still is a wonderful and important invention on the world .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am writing to you to give you more informations about an international student conference .
The group has been booked into King Hotel at High Street which is very easy to find .
And the best way to get from there to the conference is following the rod in front of the hotel to the right , then cross the zebra crossing to the opposite side .
After that walk to the right about 15 metres and you will find the conference place which is called White House .
At the end of conference , we are going to have an International Dinner as well as some shows from the students in my college .
As this is a special conference so you could wear your own national dress to present your country .
Finally , on the last day you could spend your free time to visit our town hall which you will be able to learn more about my area - or do some shopping at High Street .
If you want more information , please contact me and I am looking forward to seeing you soon .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Mr. Bill ,
I am writing to give an information on a very interesting building to visit .
It is called Penrhyh Castle , as the building will tell you all about Wales .
On the positive side , you and the group will be abe to learn more about Welsh art works which are presented on the wall , on the door and some furnitures .
The building itself looks splendid and beautiful .
And some old toilets might look awlful .
But in my recommendation , I think it would be nice for the students to come and see this building .
Because they will be able to learn and compare with the place in their country .
As Wales is not modern like America , so the students will probably get the idea of looking back to the old things .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Mrs Maria Smith .
I was really pleased to receive at your letter .
Unfortunately Richard Brown is ill but I can help you as much as I can .
So , I 'm writting to reply for giving all the information you asked for .
Firstly , we 've booked Palace Hotel , which is located in Central .
The best way to get from the hotel to the conference its using tube because it takes only 20 mininute .
The tube is 2 line which is red colour .
And your speach would be better for the end of conference party .
I 'd suggest you to wear at least , semi formal wears such as a jacket with another clothes .
Finally , I give you some suggestions which could spend for about 3 hours in the national museum in my area .
The museum can be helpful to understand our country 's history and art .
I look forward to seeing you soon .
Yours sincerely ,
Computer is the most important invention in our life .
Some people might say the electricity more important than another thingh .
It 's hard to say which is the most important invention .
However , I 'd say computer is more amazing invention rather than another inventions such as the telephone , the car .
Recently computer is really necessary and we ca n't manage to work without them .
Not only is for bussiness , but also in for my life .
For instance , when I want to contanct with to my friend , it 's quite helpful by using e - mail .
Before computer had been invented , we could n't possibly have lots of information easily and we could n't contact with to foreign countries at the same time .
And also it 's time to make new system which makes us use easier and more simple , so far more people can enjoy computer more than before .
Despite amazing invention , some times computer makes big problem , such as millennium bug ( some people called " 2000 problem " ) , because computer not flexible enough like a human 's brain .
However , computer is worth to use in our life until more coveniance machine will be invented .
Dear Mrs. Smith ,
Thank you for your letter .

We are holding the conference party at the Royal Lancaster Hotel - banqueting room at 2.00 pm on Sat .

Dear Mrs Maria Smith
Thank you for your letter which arrived me this morning .
Of course it is a pity that Mr. Brown has been ill , but we are happy that you are comeing now .
You asked me which hotel the group had been booked .
It is the Palace hotel , about a mile away where the conference will take place .
The best way to get there , is to take the bus number 7 .
The bus stop is opposite the entrance of the hotel .
You will leave the bus at , , Royal gardens " .
Turn left and go straight to , , Baker street " At the need of this street there is the house number 18 .
This is our college .
You wish to know all about , , the end - of - conference party .

The telephone a very important invention
In my early childhood my mother said to me that when she has been a litte girl there has been only one telephone in the house where she had lived .
It has been in her parents ' appartement .
The neighbours had come into to make their calls and to get their calls .
Todays nobody could imagine such a situation .
In every household there is a telephone at least .
There are a lot of advantages for it .
Firstly people are able to talk to person on every time . Be it : just for fun or also to discuss some important and relevant thins .
Moreover we always can call for help to the police , to the hospital or to a doctor .
This could save life !
An other advantage is that all offices , firms and industries could not further exist without it .
Of course there is also a big disadvantage .
All people know this situation ; people want not to be interrupted , maybe they are reading a book , having a good talk or are having a little sleep ... then the telephone rings ... !
It is not an easy desicion how to react now .
Being sincere , most of us would go to the telephone .
Another point of disadvantage is that the mobile phones are ringing . everywhere and on every time .
Especially youngsters misuse this kind of invention .
To sum up this invention is one of the most useful things .
It is always the same how to people use it or not and how people handle it .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith
thankyou for your letter , wich arrived yesterday .
I hope to give you , all the information need and please , if you want more information or somenthing is not clear , please do n't esitate to contact me again .
The Hotel is near the station and is call " Grand Placad " .
When you arrived you take the train for Guildford and after you have just across the road , in front of the station .
It 's very confortable hotel where you can find everything you need .
From there to the conference you have to take the bus number 50 , that stop near the hotel and arrive in town center .
The conference is organised in the civic hall so it is very simple to found it .
At the end of conference there is a party a perfect opportunity for your students meet new friends from all part of word and they could speak about their experience .
I suggest for that conference to wear somenthing very confortable but elegant , the organisation want for all boys wear jacket , the tie is not necessary .
I do n't know rely what you can see , three hours I think is not enough but near the station there is a beautiful garden popular for its variety of flowers .
If I found somenthing special to visit in three hours I call you .
Your sincerely

Dear Mrs Smith ,
In replied of your letter , I will try to give you some advices .
Concerning the hotel , the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel .
The conference will take place not far from the hotel so you will see indications to follow .
For the conference , I suggest you to wear a beautiful dress , because there will be important persons of others colleges .
At the end of the conference , all students and leader will have a drink .
To finish , if you have spare time , you could walk on the center of Poitiers which is very beautiful .
I hope I give you enough details .
I look forward to meeting you on the conference .
Yours faithfully ,
The building called in French " Le Centre Pompidou " is a very surprising monument .
It 's a modern building with an architecture that you ca n't see in other place .
What is impressive on this building is the number of tubes that you can see outside and inside the building .
On the Pompidou 's center , there are different expositions on different themes .
In general , there are paintings , videos and sculptures .
This expositions are often very attractive and they change every year .
Another good point , if you go there you will have an extraordinary view on the city .
So if you visit Paris , the Pompidou 's center is a very interesting building to visit , even if in Paris there are many others buildings .
Dear Mrs Smith .
I am writing in response to your letter in order to give you some further information about the international student conference in our college .
I would like to inform you that your group has been booked into Palace Hotel .
It is situated in the center of our town and it takes five minutes to get to the college , where the conference is going to be held .
I think that the best choise for you is to take the 234 bus .
The bus stop you should get off is called " The Green Man " .
With reference to the end - of - conference party , which is going to take place on Tuesday from 8:00 until midnight , I would like to mention the necessary dress code .
It is an evening dress for women and black trousers , a white shirt and a black bow tie for men .
Lastly , I would like to give you some suggestions about way in which you can spend your free time in our town .
I am strongly convinced , that you should visit local Science Museum .
Also there is a very good shopping center next to the museum .
I look forward to seeing your at the conference and hope that you will have a good time in our town .
Yours sincerely
As it is widely known , lots of different and important things were invented during the 20th century , nevertheless I believe that the most important one is the computer .
It is a fact , that the modern society have created the demand for the ability to cope with the vast amounts of information .
Taking it into consideration I would like to say that the computer is the priceless invention for an accountants , designers , engineers and so on and on .
Another point in favour is the possibility to connect to the Internet .
It allows you to have all the necessary information " on your fingertips " .
On the other hand there are some disadvantages .
For instance a lot of children nowadays replace their real life with the virtual world , which computers create .
Another drawback is that in industry computers replace people 's labour , which leads to the increasing of unemployment .
To conclude I would like to say that the goverments of all developed countries would n't have been so concerned about so - called " problem 2000 " if the computer had not been so important for the modern society .

Report on the " Paintings Museum "
In order to write this report , I spent hours in this wonderful museum .
There , I saw the exibitions and admired the building itself .
I walked around the garden too .
Location
The museum is located in Ouchy , in front of the " Delamuraz Hotel " .
It is close to the main road , and at 300 meters of the station .
Outside
The building is made of white stones .
It has two floors .
Before going inside , you have to pas through the huge garden .
There , ponds , pools , trees , flowers and ducks can be admired .
I recommend you to take your swim suit , because in summer , it is allowed to swim in pools .
Inside
When you are inside the museum , you will be impressed by the paintings on the walls .
There were all painting during the war by nurses .
If you go down a few steps , you will discover the ceilar .
Everything in this room is about wine .
To learn the whole history of the building , there is a room dedicated to it on the first floor .
I particularly recommend you to visit the " blue " room .
Everything in this room is blue , the carpet , the ceiling and even the door .
According to the owner , it was a room where in the past people used to go when they were depressed .
Conclusion
To sum up , I would like to add that this house is the most famous in our city .
You should come and visit it for the paintings or for the building itself .
You wo n't be disappointed .
The only negative point is that you have to pay 10 francs to visit . the house and the garden .

Dear Ms Helen Ryan
Competition Organiser
I have just recieved the letter , which lets me know that I have won the first prize .
I am proud of winning it and would like to say how thankful I am .
I am therefore writing to give you my further information .
First of all , I am a student and would like to travel in July .
Because I intend to take examination in Septenber .
So I can afford to go on holiday only in July .
Secondly , I would prefer to stay at log cabins rather than tents .
It will be my first time to experience to stay there and I am interested in trying new things which I have not tried .
The next consideration is the activities .
Actually , I used to play basketball for 6 years and am quite confident of it .
And nowadays , I have been practicing tennis as school activity .
Therefore I would like to choose basketball and tennis .
Finally , I am considering about what kind of clothes I should wear and how much I need .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Kim ,
Hello ! I hope everything around you is alright .
You might not believe but actually I helped at a pop concert last month and I really enjoyed it so much .
So I 'm now writing to let you know how grateful it was .
All work I needed to do was n't very interesting . which I must have set thousands chairs correctly and after finishing I put them back nicely .
The reason I enjoyed it very much is that I could meet the vocalist on setting chairs just before they started practicing .
I was asked if I wanted to sit down in front of stage .
Naturally I agreed and I could enjoy their gig as audience .
It was absolutely fantastic .
I had ever never sit down there .
Additionally , you could n't believe , but the vocalist said " All the chairs you are sitting down were set from him , " pointing at me ! !
Actually I was a bit ashamed but it will be my brilliant memory .
Anyway it was so interesting time that I did n't even feel tired after that .
Finally , I suggest you should try as I did if you have any opportunity . You must like it .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you soon .
Can you send me the letter back writing what happend to you recently .
Bye !
Love ,
At the begining I would like to thank you .
Now I am going to give you some further informations I would like to travel only in July because I am a student in High school and this is most important year of my life I am studying to university entrance exams and I have to study until the end of June and then by the end of June I will be having university entrance exam after that in July I am going to be alright .
I would prefer tents because I have never stay in tents before and I am wondering how it is going to be like And among these activities I am choosing basketball and swimming .
Basketball because I am very good at it , swimming because I like to swim very much but I 'm not a very good swimmer .
And finally I would like to ask you some questions .
My first question is about clothes ; what kind of clothes do we need to take with us ? and How much money do we need to take ?
Finally what kind of wheather is waiting for us ?
Thank you for Every thing
Your sincerely

Lausanne , the 20th of May 2000
Dear M. Smith ,
My name is Marie Bouchard , I come from Switzerland .
Two weeks ago , I spent a week in your fabulous city of London with my friend .
On Thursday , the 3rd of May 2000 , we went to your theatre to see " Over the rainbow " .
Unfortunately , we were really disappointed about everything in the theatre .
Firstly , we got our tickets in your ticket office just one hour before the show .
We thought , as usual we do in London theatre , we could have discounts as it 's written on your advertisement .
Surprisily , there were no discounds .
Secondly , the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 , it 's a theatre but not a concert hall ! ! ! !
Thirdly , we were astonished about the actors whose we know from others musical .
Why did you not change the name of your advertisement ?
In the end , the restaurant was closed because you did n't have enough staffs , this evening ! !
We really like London , the people , the night - life but this evening was really awful .
I sent to you a copie of our tickets .
Would you pleased return our money back .
In advance , thank you .
I hope we are not the only people to be so upset , but it was the first and the last time that I came in your theatre .
Sincerely yours
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
When her best friend , Scala , asked her an idea to surprise her husband because she 's pregnant , Pat put her feets in the plate just before Scala 's husband got the surprise .
The problem is that Pat works in the Neubathin a little village .
She 's a secretary in an office .
Everybody knows everybody .
Pat and Scala have been good friends for 10 years , their husband too .
It was a Friday suny afternoon , Scala was really excited to tell her the new .
Despite she knew that Pat could n't keep secret but for this time she was confident maybe too .
Just after Scala told her the new , Pat phoned her mother who worked in a bakery , to tell that Scala is pregnant .
As usual , Jon , Scala 's husband came & bought the bread for the evening .
Pat 's mum was so excited about the baby , she just said " Congratulations for the new baby . "
He was so amazed and asked to repeat .
She just thought it would be a secret , she came really embarassed .
When he went back to his house , his wife gave him the box with the shoes but it was n't a surprise !
Scala was hungry with Pat because she thought she can keep this kind of secret .
Sir manager ,
I am writing in order to complain about what you have written in the advertisement on the newspaper .
I am disappointed because of the horrible evening I have had , I was on holiday in London and I did not have time enough to spend there , but when you said that show was the best I decided to go .
When I bought my ticket I asked for a discount and they said it was not available .
At first it was not a problem because if the show was going to be the best it would cost what they said .
I arrived at the theatre in time and the musical show started later than I expected so I was getting nervous because I dislike very much the impuntuality , but that was not all .
When the show started the person who was acting it was not Danny Brook and he seemed not to be an actor .
Really he was bad .
Afterwards I decided to go for a meal in the theatre restaurant but It was closed .
So you can imagine how I felt because of the irritating evening out I had .
I am letting down because of your behaviour .
You wanted to cheat me , so I will be very pleasure if you could give my money back .
I am looking forward your answer .
Your faithfully ,
I think technology has changed my life and the way of living of almost all people around the world .
First of all technology is very useful nowadays but really I dislike it because in some ways we are becoming machines too .
Since the creation of PCs , people - and me too , of course - are making different things .
For example we can buy food , clothes and whatever we need by internet or by telephone .
I can know what is happening in differents parts of the world in a few minutes .
A very good point of this change is that women have more freedom to have a job because before reaching the technology they have to stay at home doing housework but now we have laundries and a lot of machines like microwave oven .
In my case I dislike computers .
I do n't know how to use them but I know I have to change because they help us to make our lives easier .
On the other hand what will happen with us in the future ?
Our life will be managed by robots and they will replace us in our jobs .
So , what are we going to do ?
Something that I note about technology is that we are loosing green places and there are a lot of pollution , so we have to be careful .
Dear Mr. Ryan ,
I received your letter and I am very glad I have won a two weeks travel to Camp California .
I will give you some information which helps you to know me better .
I would like to travel to camp in July because this is the best time for me and I hope for you .
I will be very busy in June so let me tell you some details about my travel .
About accommodation , I think tents would be great .
Basketball and swimming I think are the best for the children .
Basketball will help children to build team character and leadership .
And swimming is very good for health .
I swim really good and I am a proffesional basketball player .
And there are few questions I would like to ask .
First , what clothes should I take with me , secondly .
how much money and by cash or by travel cards .
Thanks !
I am looking forward to our meeting .
Yours sincerely ,
Vasiliy Alekseyev .
Dear Kim ,
Last month I enjoyed helping at concert of " Modern Talking '' and now I want to share with you about my experience .
It all started when one of the organizers asked me to help him at a concert of my favorite band .
And what do you think I answered ?
Of course , yes !
I have got very responsible work I had to bring food for Peter Bolen and Tomas Anders .
Can you imagine ?
I came into their room and give hot Cheeseburgers , Coca - Cola and ice - cream to Peter .
It was the happiest moment of my life .
He asked me was the cheeseburger hot and I answered that it was .
I was very nervous talking with him .
He told me about concert programme and gave me his photo with a sign .
I will never forget that summer day .
It was my day , I am sure about it .
Well , I think that is all .
See you .
Yours faithfully ,
Vasiliy .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writting to you about the show .
I was very disappointed after this show .
I would like to have my money back .
At first the show started at 10.15 , and it should be at 19.30 .
After your show I wanted to visit my friends , and because of it , I did n't do it .
Also , you wrote about discounts , but it 's not true !
The woman , who sold a ticket was very roud with me , actually she started swearing at me .
During the show , I was very hungry but I hoped to visit restaurant , it 's a pity , but restaurant was closed because it was too late .
And , I forget to say about actor , I did n't enjoy them .
So , I hope I will get my money back , it was very disappointing evening out in my life ! I hope you understand me !
your sincerely
Ongelina
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , but any way I trusted him .
It 's happened 3 months ago , and during this months I am very upset .
I have a friend , his name Peter , he is my best friend .
One day Peter killed one boy .
They were just playing and be acsident , Peter shoot him .
I was there , I saw it .
I hoped that it , just could see 3 people , but it was mistake ...
Pat saw it !
We spoke with Pat many times to keep this secret , not to tell anyone .
We trusted him .
At first several days , Pat all the time was with us .
He promised to keep secret , in the next morning we had arguiment with Pat , 3 of us were shouting at each other , in shorter Pat went away from us .
Two days later in the morning , the policeman came to Peter ...
So , now my best friend is prisoner .
All the time I am thinking about Peter .
I do n't forget him .
He will be in the prison 5 years .
By the way I do n't see Pat about one year .
Perhaps , he moved into another town .
It 's good that he far away ... I miss Peter very much , it 's unfair to put him in a prison .
But it 's life , destiny , very cruel destiny ...
Dear Ms Ryan ,
I am writing to you regarding the letter you sent me , about the two weeks at Camp California that I won .
Firstly , I would like to travel in July because I have 2 weeks off in the beginning of the month .
For the accommodation , I would prefer in tents because I like adventure and simplicity .
Concerning the available activities , firstly , I would choose climbing because I have practised it for many years .
Secondely , I am interested in discovering something that I have never done , so I would like to do sailing .
Finally , I was wondering if some special clothes are required and how much pocket money I need for this trip ?
I thank you in advanced and looking forward to your reply .
Yours sincerely
Dear Kim ,
I 'm writing to you to relate my experience in helping at a pop concert last month .
First of all , I would like to tell you that I 've never had a such good time in my life !
The day one consisted in surrounding the festival 's place with fences .
The second day objective was to install the scene , with lights , loudspeakers and all stuff .
This job was quite hard , but we took enough time to be not exhausted !
The last day , in fact the concert day was absolutely fantastic .
The public was so excited to see the concert that we had to place some bouncer front of the scene , to avoid the people coming on the concert floor .
Finally , the concert was exactly that the people were expected .
I hop that the next time you will come with me !
I 'm looking forward to hearing your impressions about this !
See you soon .
Dear Clark ,
I am writing to you because I would like to give my personal opinion about the ' international arts festival . '
First of all I have to say that the whole festival was a greatful success and I also think you chose an appropriate title for the leaflet .
However , there are some points which can be improved for the next year .
To begin with , you wrote down in the leaflet that stars and artists from around the world could be seen in the performance in fact their were only six countries involved .
My suggestion for this point is to invite more people from different countries .
Furthermore is that some concert halls were definitely to small or in other words to many people attended those concerts .
This kind of problem you could avoid when you look for big halls at the begining .
Another point where you could improve is when you show more plays and films next year .
Nearly at the end of this letter I have to say that the idea with the weekend ticket was really good because it gave to the people the opportunity to attemp a whole weekend for a cheap price .
To finish this letter with I would like to give you a good idea for next year .
In my opinion it would be nice if you create an exhibition place where the guests can try to play different instruments .
Yours sincerely
How can you earn money in your spare time ?
I think everybody will ask himself this question one day or has already asked it .
Anyway the people where asked this question probably found out that it is n't so easy to earn money or that it is sometimes to much work .
A traditional way to earn money , in the spare time , is to bring newspapers or magazines to the families in your town or village .
The problems that you have here is the weather .
For example when it is rainy , because then everything get wet .
Another suggestion is that you go to your cinema and ask if they need your help for changing the film rolls , for cleaning the toilets or to do some other small jobs .
But in the case that you really want to do some interesting work in your spare time you should try to sell something where you 're good at , I mean if you 're interested in computers you should try to provide your service for other people .
Of course in the begining it is hard but you can learn a lot and if you 're good at you 'll also earn some money .
Dear Sir / madam
I am writing with regard to your advertisment .
During my 2 week 's holiday I would like to attend a musical show .
It was my favorite play .
I was very hopefull that I was going to have a good time .
But there were many things which went wrong .
Firstly , I have had no discount at paying . secondly there was delay which got me into trouble , After the show I could n't catch my train .
Because I did n't have any plan I decided to have a lunch in theatre restaurant .
But it was closed .
The worst thing is that I could n't watch my favorite actor .
I was so dissapointted with that .
I could n't consentrate on the play any more .
Contrary to the advertisment everything was disapointing .
I regret to demand all my expenses .
I hope you are going to be take into consideration my terrible situation .
Yours faithfully
Azami
As a result of this our society has changed a lot .
On the one hand technology has made our lives more comfortable and easier .
On the other hand we have faced some problems , such as social and environmental problems .
Nowadays students have much more facilitis in education than before .
Although in those days the only way of learning was reading .
These days we can use computer , television and some sophisticated equipment . which were unusuall before .
Than to technology we can reach any place in the world easily .
We can get some information more quickly .
Technology has a huge effect on our spare time activities as well .
Children play wit computer instead of usuall plays .
Despite the huge facilities technology has affected our lives negatively .
There has been change relatinships between people .
People are getting more and more lonely .
We have noticed the environmential damage in recent years .
While we are using technology , we should take into consideration environment .
We should n't allow to be exploited the world .
If we want to leave a good world to the next generations , we should behave more respectfully againgst the nature .
Dear Mr. Clark ,
I 'm a italian student who has come to the last International Arts Festival .
I think this festival is a great idea because it 's a possibility to see and to love the art , but , I think also there are some things thas could be changed .
I noticed that the artists were from only six countries insted that from around the world .
This choice does n't give many artists the possibility to expresse themself .
Some concert halls were too small and often people could n't see the performances .
There were many events that I think there were a few plays and films .
Maybe it would be better put more of them in the programme because they like so much to young people .
The very about young people , the choice to offer a reasonably - priced weekend ticket is a excellent idea because it brings them to have a contact with all what it art .
I hope that my opinion can help you to set fro the next year a great internation arts festival alone to young people .
I think a good way to get money it 's work in a fast - food .
Maybe the first impression is n't positive but from my personal experience , I can say that this kind of job is right for get some money .
For six months I 've worked in a McDonald 's restaurant in Italy and I 've got lots of money .
I worked eight hours every day but in every fast - food you can work part - time , four , three , six hours every day .
It depends on what you need .
This kind of job is perfect for the young people who want get money and in the meantime they have to study .
If you work in a fast - food you can work in the afternoon , or during the night and so you have time for yourself .
In the staff you can also find young people and getting fun with them during the work .
What do you want more ?
If you need money and you need time for yourself try a job like that .

Dear Mrs Ryan ,
I recived your letter and I am very excited about the camp .
I would like to go in July I do n't mind wich two weeks but it has to be that month because in June I still in school and in August I'am going on holiday with my family .
I would prefer to sleep in a tent because I think it 's different from where I sleep every night so I would apreciate it if there are still tents available .
One of the activities I would prefer to do is Climbing , I haven't done a lot of it but I 've always found it interesting and I think this would be a good opportunity to become better in it .
The other activity I would like to take is tennis , I 'm quite good at it and I have been practising for four years .
I would like to know what type of clothes I should take and also if I need to take money with me .
Thanks for your attentions .
Yours sincerely ,

Dear Kim ,
Hello girl how are you doing this days .
I am great especially last weekend in the concert of Backstreet Boys .
It was so exciting .
They were giving two concerts one in Friday and the other one in Saturday they invited me to go on friday .
This is what happened : when I arrive they told me that I was helping in backstage with the scenery , then the group arrived , we chat for like 15 minutes then they had to go on stage .
Here is where the good part starts , I was doing the courtines ( opening and closing ) when Nick came to me and ask me to go on stage with him , my heart started beating very hard .
The next second I was in front of more than 2 thousand people dancing with The Backstreet Boys .
I had a great time that day .
Well I have to go now .
Hope to hear from you later on .
Love ,
Anni .
Dear Sir / Madam The Circle Theatre manager
I am writing to complain about your product .
I would like you to back my money because that was not same as your advertisement .
I was planning to spend my holiday in London when I found your advertisement .
In the advertisement , you mentioned actors , time , price discount and equipment .
DANNY BROOK is one of my favorite actor so I decided to buy a ticket even if I cancel my apointment on that day at 18=30 and aslo notice of price discount impressed me .
However , when I went to the theatre , you did n't anything not only discount but also apporogize us for dalay of starting musical .
In addition different actor appeared on the stage and I could n't have dinner about the musical because the restrant had been closed .
It made me so dissapoint and angry .
You should back my money immedeastry because that night was far from parfect .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Faithfully ,
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
He always tried to say nothing and did .
But everyone always noticed he had secrets from his face .
Whenever he has secrets , his nose moves quickly .
He had not liked this habit and had thought it was wrost of him until he solved a big crime .
When all money had gone from a bank , nobady there except Pat .
Bank robbers said him if Pat told the fact somebody they killed him .
So .
Pat did n't say anything .
But his nose moved quickly when police showed a picture of bank robbers .
Then police realized who were bank robbers and arested them .
Although bank robbers complained to Pat , he said nothing to anybody .
He just moved his nose ! !
Thanks to his habit , he is still alive and all money were backed to the bank .
The town became peace again .

Well here in Dublin things still the same , but I think somebody told you that I went to the moby concert here at the point wich is the big theatre for events and concerts , I guess it was the best concert I 've ever been to , but the coolest thing is that , well do you remember my friend Luke , the one that works as a security guard , well he told me that they needed people to put everything on the stage , so I went to help them and everithing else , and when I get into the point , do you who was there ?
just imagine , it was moby , so I went to say hello to him , and he told me would you give me a hand with my decks , so I went , and when we finished he gave me a T - shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row , oh my god Kim that the best thing that ever happened to me , well Kim I hope to recieve a letter from you soon , and please tell everybody about the moby concert and everything , thank you .
See you soon

And now to be the first winner .
Is wonderful for me to have the opportunitie to visit the Camp California in the U.S.A.
In answer at your letter .

And for the second question .
About accommodation during these two weeks at the Camp I would prefer log cabins ; because maybe is more interesting to share with other people .
In other hand you ask me I have the chance for to choose two activities while I am at the camp . but is no easy , because all is very interesting for me .
But anyway I like more to have the possibilities for practice climbing and surfing .
Can you said me if is necessary to bring special clothes , I refer for instance if I practice surfing I need water suit .
Is possible to get there ?
At the same situation for climbing I need special equipment and then there are available in the Camp and what about the guide for these activities ?
I need extra money ?
I am really appreciate if you can answer me these doubt and saying again .

Shopping is not always enjoyable .
I think this topic is so exciting in the antropological and psicological point of view , because we can studie the reaction before , during and after to shopping .
People in general have a compulsory actitud for shopping in my opinion .
Because sometimes the article for to buy is not really necessary . We must to accept that media have so important effect in our life in special the T.V.
For the men and women is important the appearance and they spent a lot of money in buy clothes , cosmetic , accesories , jewels etc .
And the other they choose sometimes just for the label .
Without give really importance to the calidad in reference to the appearance there is more preocupation in the food area , because people in general they do n't spent the time for prepare food and when they shopping they choose pre - prepared food .
We know is more easy for these busy life .
In the other hand the facilities for access to mall center is not good .
The area for parking , space for play grown to the children or bus station near the mall is not really appropiate .
Otherwise shopping will be more enjoyable .
I think in the nearly future we need to decide with the goverment .
which is special place in the town we lefet just for comerical area , but of course with all the facilities to get there like a big supermarket , and mall centre in different areas of the city .
DEAR SIR ,
I AM WRITING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT A MUSICAL SHOW THAT IS TAKING PART IN THE CIRCLE THEATRE .
I WAS WORRIED WHEN I SAW THE ADVERTISEMENT OF THE PLAY IN A NEWSPAPER ON SUNDAY .
THE FIRST PROBLEM WAS WHEN I READ THE STARRING .
IT SAID : ' DANNY BROOK ' .
BUT , WHEN I WAS WATCHING THE PLAY , I REALISED THAT THERE WAS A DIFFERENT ACTOR AND , REALLY , I WAS DISAPPOINTED .
ANOTHER PROBLEM WAS THE TIME THAT I HAD TO WAIT .
I THOUGHT IT WILL BE AT 19.30 AND I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES ! ! BESIDES THIS , I COULD NOT VISIT THE RESTAURANT IN THE THEATRE BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED .
IN ADITION TO THIS , I DID NOT HAVE ANY DISCOUNT IN MY TICKET .
SO , I HAD TO PAY A LOT OF MONEY TO SEE A PLAY THAT WAS A COMPLETELY DISASTER .
TO SUM UP , I DID NOT SPEND A PERFECT EVENING .
I THINK THAT IT WAS THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD .
ON THE WHOLE , I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK .
YOURS FAITHFULLY
MANUELA BELABARA
JUST BE YOURSELF
IN , THE FUTURE , PEOPLE WILL BE WEARING FASHIONABLE CLOTHES LIKE NOW .
PEOPLE WILL BE VERY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THEY WEAR .
ONE THE ONE HAND , THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WOULD WEAR FASHIONABLE CLOTHES .
THIS PEOPLE WILL BE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE .
ON THE OTHER HAND , THERE WILL BE LESS PEOPLE WHO WOULD WEAR WHATEVER THEY LIKE .
NOWADAYS , PEOPLE SEEM TO BE ALWAYS WORRIED .
ALL THE TIME THEY ARE ASKING , WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING LIKE AND THEY WASTE A LOT OF MONEY IN CLOTHES .
ON THE WHOLE , CLOTHES WILL HAVE NO CHANGE .
IN MY OPINION , PEOPLE WILL GIVE IMPORTANCE TO HOW THEIR PERSONALITY DEVELOP AND THEY WILL GIVE UP WORRYING ABOUT WHAT THEY WEAR .
THEY WILL HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY WHAT THEY NEED AND TO BE HAPPY WITH IT .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to complain about the musical show " Over the Rainbow " , that I went to see on the 16th of June .
Firstly , the actor suppossed to be Danny Brook , but he was not , it was another actor , who I have never seen before , so , as you can imagen , I was very disappointed .
Another complain is about the time that the musical show started , the advertisement said it started at 19:30 , but it did not , we had to wait 45 minutes .
It was terrible .
Now , about the tickets , the were different prices but there were not discounts , and because of this , many people could not see the show , especially students .
Finally , when the musical show finished , and I have to say , a bit late , I went to the theatre 's restaurant to eat something but this place was closed because the chef had already gone .
At is explain it was not the perfect evening that I expected to have and I would like to have my money back because of the reasons that I mentioned before .
Looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
Pat , Maria 's best friend
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , so Maria was very disappointed when she realised that Manuel knew the truth about the feelings that Maria had for him , in fact , she was so angry she almost kill but , she could n't because Pat was her best friend .
Maria talked to Pat about the stupid thing that she did , but Pat refused to apologaising to her , because she felt it was n't a mistake and she did it for only one reason : help Maria to get the man that she loved .
Maria was speechless , it was the first time that she did n't know what to do , so she decided to stop talking to Pat .
After 3 weeks , Maria got ill so she was not available to go to school .
Some friends phoned her everyday , except Pat , the only friend that Maria really loved , despite that , she was not sad .
One day , when Maria was seating in her bedroom , someone knock the door , it was Manuel , he was worried for her .
Maria was nervous , but for the first time , she could talk to him as she never did before , and at the end of the day , she was the happiest person of the world , she gave her first kiss and she had Pat 's friendship back , after all , everything happened because of her .

Dear Mr Robertson ,
First of all , we would like to thank you very much for organising such a wonderfull trip with an interesting program .
We are all extremely excited especially because of the trip to Greenwich , the town we were always interested in .
However , there are may other interesting places and exhibitions to see in London .
For example , in the time of our visit there is going to be " The London Fashion and Leisure Show " .
It is a coinsidence which we would be extremely happy to take advantage on .
This is a great opportunity for us to see the latest fashions and famous fashion models who we would like to have authograps from .
We hope changing the excursion program a little will not cause any problems .
Our suggestion is to visit Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday .
Because the fashion show lasts a whole day long .
We are ready to give up our shopping and Free time .
The show starts on 14th March at 10.00 and ends at 19.00 the same day .
We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by our request .
Yours faithfully
Famous people are living creatures .
They breathe , eat , feel and beside that they are famous they are just the same as anyone else .
Nobody likes to be observed constantly or touched by strangers and pointed out in the streets with no right even or just a little privacy .
I personally think the best would be to put the celebrities in cages and let people touch them , point and ask for authopraps .
Like in the zoo .
The biggest commercial gain in history I believe , but celebrities are not animals although they may be sometimes treated the same way .
On the other hand , they must have done something to become famous .
It may in many cases , not be true but we can suspect that most of them wanted to become a celebrity and they had to know there is no private life unseparately contected to it .
To sum up , I believe that everyone has the right to keep privacy of their own homes and even someone extremely famous deserve to have a private life .
Unfortunately as long as their private life is interesting for ordinary people and it brings commercial gain to publishers , journalists and photographers , famous people will just have to get use to this living " under a microscope " .
Dear Jane Clark ,
The purpose of this letter is to congratulate you on the International Arts Fesival I attended last weekend .
I believe that the event was good , however I feel that the festival can be improved next year .
Firstly I would like to tell you that the idea of organizing an International Arts Festival is fantastic , but in your advertisement it was said that I would find stars and artists from arround the world , when , in fact , they were from only six countries .
I do understand that it must be difficult to get these people to go to the festival , but it would be nice if next year we could meet other personalities .
Secondly I belive you should know that a lot of people , including me , were not able to enjoy concerts because some concert halls were too small .
I would be very thankful if you could tell me if there will be more plays and films next year .
Last but not least I would like you to know that I think the idea of the weekend ticket for all events was excellent because in the end it was cheaper than paying for each event separatelly .
I hope you find my opinion useful .
Once again congratulations on the Festival .
I hope to hearing from you soon
yours sincerelly ,
tips to earn money
When the holidays began everybody is happy because it represents the beginning of a time full of fun and lots of interesting things to do , but in order to do these things we all need money and that is a big problem to most of us .
there are several ways to earn a bit of money in your spare time .
One of the most common examples is baby- sitting taking care of little children is easy and it does n't require special skills , all you need is a lot of patience .
If looking after children does n't fit you , you can try with pets .
Lots of people would pay you to take their dog for a walk .
So if you like animals this is your chance to earn money and have fun at the same time .
Another option is to wash your neighbour 's car .
In this case you need to buy the materials you will work with , but do n't worry , soap is not very expensive .
the most important thing is that you wisely choose the most suitable work for you , according to the things you like to do .
If you do n't find anything good enough for you do n't worry , you should always remember : It 's not all about the money !
To Mr Robertson ,
Firstly , I would like to thank you for the programme that you provided .
It was very good programme , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which I am sure the whole class would enjoy .
However , our class has spotted an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and would all wish to attend .
It will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on the 14th March .
It will be from 10.00 till 7.00pm .
The show will be about all the latest fashion , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles .
We would also not have to worry financially as it is free for students .
This will be a great opportunity for us because we will be able to find out more about the people of London and their fashions and style we might also get a change to meet new people and interest with them .
The whole class is also very excited about this fashion show and would really appreciate your giving them a change to go .
I have a few suggestion on how the programme could be changed to fit the London Fashion and Leisure Show in .
We could do as planned for Monday and move going to the Science Museum from Tuesday to Wednesday afternoon .
We would have to forgo the shopping as we might not have enough time and the exchange rate might be too high for us to do much shopping .
We can however go and look around the shopping mall if we have time after the show .
Lastly , I would be very grateful if you could give us your permission to go to the show .
I hope you would consider this matter .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Everyday , something changes and we become more modern companies use computers instead of books , dentist use modernized electrical item instead of just a plier , even homes are effected .
From letters to emails , from gas stoves to electric stoves and microwaves , but we are n't just going to stop here are we ?
No , in the future , the present will be the past and these things now new to use will be old , outdated and changed .
I see a very different home for us in the future .
Most things will be computerised .
We might even be using voice identification and fingerprints instead of keys .
We an on and off lights with touch pads and remote controllers .
We might even be able to open the door without getting out from the living room .
Cameras will be something usual in every house instead of that little peephole in your door .
Although all that may change our houses may be still the same .
The rooms and size should remain as it was and the living rooms and all may still be decorated in the same style .
We might still favour that old carpet and couch .
The furniture should not change that much on the outside and the amount of rooms should not change too .
In the future , every child might have a laptop .
And instead of going to school , why not let school come to you ? We will be learning at home using computers and disc .
Never have to leave the house or wake up so early .
Another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilitles we are using .
We might not need maids to do housework anymore as they can easily be replaced with a robot , a machine , or something other with the same purpose .
Our homes will still be the same in terms of the kitchen , it will still be filled with vegetables and meat .
This is because people wo n't miss the great taste of food although it could be subsituted to a vitamin pill or two .
Lastly , I think that all this changes wo n't really be noticed as we change it daily and slowly instead abruptedly .
People will be able to adjust and change with the times .
Dear Mr Robertson ,
On behalf of our class I would like to give you some information about the London Fashion and Leisure show , that we saw advertised and we are interested indeed .
In addition we would like to thank you about the programme .
Firstly , I would like to give you some details about this show .
It will take place in Central Exhibition Hall , in London , on Tuesday 14th of March and the suitable time will be 10.00 - 19.00
I would like to mention that this day we are going to visit the Science Museum in the morning and after we are going for shopping , so I believe it will be a good change for all of us to attend this show as it is free for students !
The most important thing is that the time that the show starts is perfect and is suitable as well with our programme because until 19:00 I think that everyone will have finished their shopping .
Secondly , I would like to give you more details about the show and particularly what does it include .
The latest fashion will be on show and also the Leisure and sports wear . Really interesting !
Moreover all about the make up and the hairstyles . I think that it will be a great opportunity to all of us to be on this show while we are going to be in London .
But , if there is a problem that the show is on Tuesday afternoon , the same hour with shopping , I suggest having the shopping on Wednesday afternoon that we will not have anything to do !
I look forward to your reply ,
Yours sincerely ,
Some people think that to be a famous person is very excuiting thing , that all the time this makes you feel completely and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well .
I believe , that if somebody wants the fame and the glory must be tottally sure about the results .
For example , the politicians the have choosed their careers , they must know that they are going to involved with everything that it has to do with publicity and their country and the most important is that they have to realize that they should be extremely careful of their movements or else they are going to have bad reputation , and they will be not trustworthy .
Another succesfull carreer such as , film stars must also be balanced .
If somebody is a film star this mean that has got a different kind of life , more comfortable , more interesting but it does n't mean that he or she ca n't be like normal people even if he or she is a star .
If somebody wants to be famous of cource must be on the top and the mass media will be following him or her .
But I think that the are limits .
Everybody deserve to have a private life even if he is a plumber or even if she is a famous singer .
It does n't matter what kind of carreer or job you are follow .
And finally the journalists the should know how to respect the private life of everyone and not trying to make money for a living by using the reputation of the famous people .
Dear Mr Robertson ,
Firstly , I 'm writing to thank you the great opportunity you give us , especially in planing all this programme in a such acurate way .
I think that this programme has a good organisation , as you know , due to we have enough time to visit plenty of local interest points .
But , I was wondering , like a student of this college , if we would change part of this programme ... we 'd like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
It takes place on Tuesday 14th and begins at ten o'clock .
In this way , we can go to visit the Science Museum earlier in the morning and the , we can go to the show .
Front my point of view , we are very interested in the latest fashions like the leisure , sports wear , make up , hairstyles , you know ... I strongly believe that we will be at the right time and best city to appreciate it .
Please let me know if you are agree with us !
Oh I forgot about it !
Besides , this show is gree ( another positiu point ) .
Looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely
FANCY GETTING TO KNOW THE FUTURE ?
Do you think you 've the future in your hands ?
Do you think we 're living like old times ?
Would you like living in a modern way ?
What do you expect about the future ?
Can you compare it ... ?
Are you afraid ?
Well , you can look at your house ...
Nowadays , we have all kind of instruments to washing up the dishes , to cook to be more comfortable , for example the TV , the video recorder , etc .
Maybe , in a few years later we 'll have a bigger TV , a more suitable radio but , from my point of view , I think these facts will not change the way of our lifes . We will be able to accelerate the process of the computer 's games for example ...
But not in the strange way you can imagine ...
I mean I do n't think we 'll change cars by aereoplanes ...
In this way , you have to be calm because as you know the things are developing in the same way you'r changing , too .
In conclusion , I strongly believe that the the house of the future will be the house of a new mindness it will be a very positiu point for opening our lifes .
So , we have the future in our hands !
Think about it .
Dear Principal , First of all , we would like to thank you for good programme which provides us 3 days stay in London .
It contains a wide range of activities for example , sightseeing , river trip , visiting science museum and gallery , shopping .
It is certain that the programme will give the students considerable enjoyment .
However , we have found an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show , which will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th of March .
The advertisement says that the show is full of many interesting programmes , such as the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles etc .
Moreover , students are allowed to admit for free .
All of us would like to attend the show because young people , particularly girls are interested in fashion and make up , so we are expecting the show will be the great opportunity to see what the new trend in fashion will be like .
It would be grateful if you give a little change in programme so that we are able to attend the show .
It seems to be good to change the programme of 14th into the London Fashion and Leisure show , instead of the science museum and shopping .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Technical and Warm Home People 's way of life has considerably been changed by rapdily developing mordern technology .
To begin with , it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house .
50 years ago , Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning woods to warm a room up and make food .
Since the eletric fire and microwave oven had been invented , their life have been far easier than before .
Today , however , people do not need to spend many times on making food , washing up , or even on turning on an off the light .
Machines , such as a dish washer , laundry machine and remote controller help us jut to relax or do a little work necessary .
From my point of view , people 's home in the future will be controlled by a computer which is devised in every machine , TV , cooker and the light , connecting to the owner .
He / she can just press the button or send e - mail to operate what he / she needs , even though the owner is far from the house .
On the other hand , people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a " family " .
In spite of the computer , children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer , but by parents themselves .
Computer might know better than human , but there are many things which it can not replace in our life .
Dear Ms Ryan ,
I was enthusiatic about receiving your letter . I will give you all the necessary information .
I would like to travel in July because during that period I will be free from work , my current post finishes at the end of June but I will start another job at the beginning of August .
I would prefer to stay in tents rather than in log cabins , because it would be a new experience for me and I would like to try something different .
As far as the activities are concerned , I have chosen to do Tennis and Swimming .
I am good at playing Tennis and I have been learning to swim for three months so it could be a useful training for me .
Moreover I would like to know what kind of clothes are the best for living in the camp and if I need to bring with me a large amount of money .
I want to thank you for this prize , let me know if you need further information .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Bianca Botticelli
Dear Kim ,
In your last letter you asked me about the concert ... oh it was fantastic !
I 've always loved music so working in a concert was great .
You ca n't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert , apart from the musicists and the singers , there are people who work with lights , who organize the security service ... it was so exciting !
My work consisted in checking the tickets , the number on them and taking the people to their seats .
It was also very tiring because all the people arrived at the same time and they did n't want to wait for my help ; so they went around the theatre , looking for their seats and making so much noise .
Sometimes I think that people never grow up , if they had been a class of children , they would have made less noise ! !
Anyway , it was a great experience in spite of these little problems .
Now I have to go , write soon and let me know what you have been doing .
Lots of love
Bianca

Dear Helen :
I 've recived your letter and I am pleased to have won because I needed some days to relax myself and to leave the city , which is very extressing .
I only can travel on July because I am working in an office and I must ask my boss for a holiday and it 's the mounth he can give me , so I hope it is n't a problem for you .
To spend the two weeks I would prefer to live in tents , that 's in my opinion a way to be nearer the enviroment and the animals , although I do n't mind living in log cabins .
In spite of liking all the sports you wrote in your letter I am only good at climbing and sailing , because I am used to practise them with my father since I was a child .
I have got a doubt , it is not very important , but I would like to know if I need any money or all is payed , the kind of clothes I should wear , if the weather is good or bad ... and all the extra information you can send me .
Thank you very much for the prize .
Yours faithfully .
Eliza Vasquez .
Why people like so much go shopping ?
In my opinion the majority of the people that go shopping are women who must buy food and other kind of things for her family , so for them , shopping is a very boring activity that is repeated everyday and that drive them crazy when they have to choose the best product and the cheapest price to save some money .
Othrewise , there are people who think the opposite ; such as : children , teenagers , men ; but not always , because they go to buy hardly ever , only when they need clothes or something for their job or school .
In that way shopping can be as funny as you want , although if you do it very often , it will be as an obligation in the future .
To sum up , all you make in small cuantities is good and funny , but do n't encrease them if you do n't want to feel uncomfortable .
Dear Ms Ryan
Thank you for your letter .
I was so happy to hear that I have won a two weeks holiday in the U.S.A.
I would like to travel in July . I am going to finish my exams in June , and I am planning to go back to China in early August .
So if I could travel in July , and coming back before 6th of August , that would be great .
I would prefer living in tents to log cabins .
I have never had any experience to live in a tent , so I would like to give it a go .
I think I will enjoy myself in a tent .
I love swimming , but I am not any good at swimming .
I really wanted to learn how to swim .
I was wondering if there is a coach could give us a lesson during the Camp .
Also , I would like to join basketball team , I used to play basketball when I was in high school , and our high school basketball team have won many competitions during last ten years in our city .
I am glad I had taken a part in a few competitions , and I was so proud of our basketball team .
Would you tell me that how much money you would give it to me and how is the weather like in U.S.A. Thank you for every thing !
Yours faithfully
Dear Kim ,
It was great to hear from you , haven't seen you since last summer holiday , hope everything is fine in your place .
You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert which I enjoyed helping last month ?
I must say that was a great fun , I 've never had this kind of experience before .
Before the concert actually started I had to give out lots of leaflets , they are list of pop band and group which will appear in the concert in order , and some information about their performance and backgrounds .
After that , I had to help people who had a ticket but ca n't find their seat .
During the concert , I did n't have a lot to do , so I had chance to see most of the performance , that was excellent .
I was excited that I had a closer look at so many famous pop stars .
During break time I did give a lots of direction to people who ca n't find toilet , and information such as where they could have a cup of coffee .
That was bit boring , but it was part of my job .
I got to go .
Write to you next time .
Love
Tuesdy 13th , June , 2000
Dear Ms Ryan ,
I am writing in response to your letter about the first prize in the Competition .
I am very looking forward to going to California and I would like to go in July , because I am going to have my summer holidays in that month .
About accommodation , I would prefer log cabins , because I have a problem in my back .
Therefore , I need to sleep in a bed .
Also tents are not fairly comfortable .
As far as camp activities concerned , I have been doing windsurfing for 5 years , for that reason , I am fairly interested in sailing .
On the other hand , I keen on painting , however , I have never painted in my life , so I would like to try it .
Finally , I was wondering what kind of clothes I have to wear in California ?
In addition , could you advice me how much money I need for the trip ? and is there anything else do I have to know ?
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours Sincerely

Hello Kim ,
I 've received your letter two days ago and I 'm quite happy to know that you passed F.C.E. I 'm ok and let me tell you about my last experience .
I went to Madrid last week and I was walking in the street when somebody asked me an address .
I looked at him and I realised that this person was David Bowie .
Yes ! ! !
I could n't believe it .
He was trying to speak in Spanish , but his accent was terrible .
So , I started to speak in English with him .
I explained to him where was the street that he was looking for and we carried out with the conversation for a while .
I thought he was very rude , but I was wrong , he is n't arrogant at all and he looks very simply .
I liked my experience with him and I think the best part was when he gave me his e - mail address .
Yeah ! !
!
I 'm not joking , I got his e - mail .
Well my friend , I have to go , because I got an appoinment with the Dentist .
Write me soon and take care .
Best wishes
Dear Helen ,
I learnt from you letter that I 've won the first prize .
I felt how luck I was .
I understood you want to know when am I available to set off and where I 'd like to stay .
First of all I will be able to go U.S.A in July because of my university .
I am studying Economics and I am very busy nowadays .
My exams will have finished at the end of June .
I will only be able to set off in July and I also will give my thesis to my teacher in August .
This holiday will help me to think and prepare it .
I 'd prefer staying in log cabins because I need a proper place to say and study .
Basically , I do n't like staying in a small tent .
When I get the camp , I 'd like to swim and climb .
I used to climb mountains and am good at climbing .
I am fond of swimming but unfortunately I am not a good swimmer .
Is there any toilet and shower in the log cabins or somewhere nearby ?
Do I have to bring any special clothes ?
Do you have any idea what is the weather going to be ?
How much mone do you recommend me to bring with me ?
Is the camp close to town or city ?
Will you provide me an instructor when I climb and swim ?
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Kim ,
I haven't written you for ages .
I do apologise for this .
How are you ?
How is your new school and parents ? I hope we can catch up with each other 's news .
Last month I helped the service crew at a pop concert .
It was unbelievable and tiring as well .
I saw all the pop bands and singers .
I heard them talking behind the stage .
They signed my diary and took a photo with me .
Being a security guard was the hardest task .
Carrying big speakers place to place was extremely tiring but we had loads of laugh .
Believe it or not I put make up on one famous singer 's face .
I was just walking down by dressing room manager said that if I could help them .
I could n't believe my eyes .
I was in her room and helping her .
Especially I liked that time .
I advise you to do something like that .
I 'm going to help them again .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Miss Ryan ,
I 'm writing to you as regards the letter you 've sent me about the competition I 've won .
I 've never been to the U.S.A. before so I think it 'll be an exciting trip .
With regard to the date of the trip , July would be best because in June I 'm going to visit my family in Mexico and in August school begins .
I 've never been camping before , I guess I 'm not an outdoor girl , but I 'd like to give it a try , so I 'd rather tents than cabins .
I 'm really keen on sports , especially sailing .
I 've practised sailing since an early age and I perfectly manage the rigging and sail .
I 'm also fond of tennis , I 've just started my lessons and would like to continue practising during the summer .
So , I think I 'll do sailing and tennis .
I 'm not really sure of what kind of clothes to take , could you please write to me specifying what would be suitable ? I 'd appreciate it a lot .
Sincerely ,
Diana Delgado
Shopping is not always enjoyable
I 'm a shopaholic , but I have to admit shopping is not always enjoyable .
For instance , I spent my Spring Break with my friends in Italy , we went there to buy our dresses for our boyfriends ' graduation ( besides other reasons ) .
They had invited us and we wanted them to see us stunningly beautiful .
While we were in Florence my wallet was stolen , probably by a gypsie .
I was so annoyed !
I was in the Plaza Espagna in Florence without a penny !
My friends lent me some money , but it was n't more than 120 pounds .
I had to buy my dress , it 's accesories and besides clothes and souvenirs !
I could n't really do much , so I used the money I had and bought an incredible pair of shoes and some souvenirs .
I felt really bad seeing my friends buy the latest fashion while the only thing I could do was tell them how great their clothes were and of course window - shop .

Dear Kim
Thank you very much for your last lovely letter .
I 'm fine .
How are you ?
You are interessted on my last job ! I really like to tell you all my experience .
However , I 'm happy that we finished this hard work . I worked in a team by seven people .
We were mainly on work for all the lights at this great concert .
Its sounds easy , just for the light .
In addition , it was a nine days hard work to mount all the different spot and houndreds of Coblights on the right place .
Finally , we had worked the hohl night befor the concert .
We had to adjust the laser extremly on the correct position .
We spent hours till it was good enough for the Technical - manger .
Moreover , the band was exhausted about this great laser show at the end .
For me was this aventure one of the Best .
It shows , when all member of a group work hard together , you can reach a lot .
Lots of Love

Dear Manager ,
With this letter I want to show you some problems I had last week in your theatre with your show .
First of all , I want to introduce myself .
I 'm Francesco Schein , I 'm 18 years old and I went last week to see your musical show " Over the Rainbow " .
I was very upset because the show had many problems .
First the actor was changed and his performance was very poor and disappointing .
Then , the show began 45 minutes later , so we had to wait very long .
The advertisement said there were discounts available , which were not .
At the end you said it will be a Restaurant , but it was closed , so we could n't eat anything untill we got home .
I hope you understand your faults and I 'm asking you for the money back .
Faithfully Yours
I do n't know if technology has totally changed my life , because I was born with it and I have learned it since I was a little boy .
For example , I was born knowing the man has stepped on the moon .
There are some machines which have helped in my development , and others which help me to make my life easier .
The computer for example makes communication much easier and faster then in past time , when everything was send by common mail , and it took weeks till it got the right place .
There are other machines which are bad for the environment .
Many industries throw their contaminated air away , without cleaning it before .
Technology has to move further so it can solve problems as pollution , so we can live better and longer .
Dear Helen
I am very surprised for have received your letter in which you explained to me that I have won prize in your competition .

Now , I will answer your requests .
In reference about the date of the travel , I would like to travel in July because at the moment I am working at the University and I only have July to take my holidays .
As state in your letter I have to choose the accommodation type . I would prefer to stay in tents because since I was a child I have being using this type of accommodation .
I used to go to campings .
About camp activities I would prefer to do basketball and photography .
I have choosen these activities because actually I am playing with university team , and photography is my favoorate hobby .
I have recently bought a new camera .
Finally let me know what kind of clothes will be the most suitable at camp .
Is necesarilly bring to me money in there ?
I look forward to hearing from you
Yours sincerely
Dear Kim
I am writen to you telling about my experience at a pop concert .
It began when ours common friends Martha , ofered me to be a organization member at the concert , obviously I accepted .
Now I can tell you that it was an amaizing challange for me because I never did anything like that .
My duties like a organization member were diferent , the firts day I had to pick the bands up at the airport , for it I hired a van .
The following day I was the person who provide the meals for all the organization staff and besides every day I was at the back - stage supporting the catering staff .
Particularly I am pleased to had know the most popular pop stars in the world .
Hopping to hear from you
Best wishes
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing to you to complain about the musical show " Over the Rainbow " .
I have recently been in London for spending a week 's holiday .
As I am an enthusiasmic of musicals I went to see this musical show .
I am very disappointed because the things that were writen on the advertisment were not really true .
It was writen that the stars would be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
Danny Brook is one of my favorite actors and there was playing another one .
I felt abosolutly disapointed .
The musical should have begun at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 ; it is inacceptable !
It was writen too that there were discounts available and I asked for them and they said me that they were n't allow to do any discount .
After the show me and my friends wanted to have a drink and the theatre restaurant was closed because there were n't enough drinks .
As you say in your advertisment it was not my perfect evening out and therefore I would like to have my money back .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
Ms MARIA AROZ
How has modern technology changed our daily life ?
Modern technology has changed a lot our daily life .
On one hand nowadays if we have to travel to Paris and return in the same day you can take a plane without any problem .
In the past it was impossible to go to Paris from Barcelona and come back in one day .
Another advantage is that if you go on an excursion and you take your mobile phone , if you get lost somebody could find you .
I think that the most important modern technology in these days is internet .
With internet you can do whatever you want without going out home ( shoping , speaking with a friend , working , putting your money aside .... )
On the other hand the main disadvantage is that using modern machines it can be very difficult for ederly people ; it would be very pratitable if the modern industries train people about using modern technologies .
To sum up modern technology has change a lot our daily life and this is going to increase .
Dear Mr Robertson !
I 'm writting to you to thank you for good programme of our English class in London , especially for river trip to Greenwich , it will be a great experience for us .
But the students in our class have seen an adverstisement for the " London Fashion and Leisure Show " which'll take place in Central Exhibition Hall , London , on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 and at the same time we have to go to the Science Museum but we would all like to go to the show .
It will be very interesting for us to see the latest fashions , make up , hairstyles and we can speak to English people and make new friends .
There is one more advantage : it is free for students .
So we would like to suggest you how the programme could be changed .
First of all on Tuesday we all will go to the show and spend there all our day , but on Wednesday in the afternoon when we have free time we can go to the Science Museum if you do n't mind , of course .
Please let us know , as soon as you make your decission .
With best wishes , your student .
Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie
Dear Lucas !
Thank you very much for your letter , I was glad to get it and know a lot of news about you .
First of all I want to congratulate your cousin with fifteenth birthday and with all the best .
I hope that it will be good holiday for her , her family and friends .
Now about your questions , it is very difficult for me to give any advice you about it , I do n't know your cousin very well so I do n't know what she prefers reading .
But when I was fifteen my favourite book " Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie " .
So I can recommended you to present this book , because it is very interesting , amuse , sometimes dramatic and mystery book .
This book help us to impove our logic , mind , memory and it teaches the reader not to lie , be more honest with other people and pay attention for the smallest details in our life because sometimes it can help us very very much .
So I hope I could help you .
Write me as soon as you can .
With best wishes , your
I have just received your letter , and thank you very much for your reply .
I am very happy to take part in the competition and I would like to give you all the information you need :
First of all , I am available to travel in July from 1st to 20th because my university will be closed during this month .
Secondly , if you do n't mind , I would prefer to sleep in a tent .
Although it is not very comfortable , I like camping very much .
Thirdly , I am very interested in swimming and also climbing .
I took up climbing five years ago and I am very keen on .
I am very good at swimming as well because I practise this sport every week in my city .
Finally , could you tell me what I need to dress and also how much money I will spend on .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
I have asked to write a composition regarding the questionit is believed that shopping is not always enjoyable .
In fact , to do shopping can be some disavantages for different reasons :
Firstly , you have to queue for a long time to get a free cabin and waste of time putting on some clothes and in the end they are not the right size .
Secondly , it is easy to spend a lot of money in few minutes and as soon as you can regret to buy all these clothes , which you do n't really need .
Thirdly , some clothes can have some stains on and you haven't noticed this before buying , so you have to go back to the shop .
However , it is not easy to get a refund or to change them .
In my opinion , doing shopping bring me a lot of satisfaction especially I am depressed , nevertheless it could be very dangerous for my wallet .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I 've read your advertisement and it did n't say the truth .
There were n't any discount available as you 'd assured in the add .
I think you should check the information before print it !
I arrived at the right time ( 19.30 ) that evening but the play , which was ' Over The Rainbow ' , started almost an hour later .
And nobody told me why !
When the play began I realised that the main actor had been changed and the new one was n't good at all .
I could n't visit the theatre after the performance because it was closed for reparations .
Why did n't you say something about it ?
I did n't have the ' perfect evening out ' you 'd promised so I want to ask for my money back because your service was terrible .
Please answer my letter as soon as possible .
I 'll be looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
Marcella , Scalia C.
' How Has Modern Technology Changed My Daily Life ? '
This is not a simple question because I got used to dealing with technology since I was a child but I 'm going to try to explain you how .
I did n't have a computer until I was eight .
Then my brother and I started to develop a new ability .
In that time I used the computer only to play with its video games .
When I was thirteen I discovered a completely different use for my computer .
It became scencial to do my homework .
And years later it enabled me to get a very good job .
One day my mother got a terrible disease .
She had to be operated on and my family and I were very scared .
But when we talked to the doctor we felt more relaxed because he answered us that the operation was a very simple one .
I think that if my mother had got ill ten years before , she would n't survive .
The modern technology is better now than what it used to be .
What do you think about this ?
I 'm sure that these arguments have explained my point of view , haven't they ?
Now I would like to have your point of view .
Dear Mrs. Ryan ,
I 'm writing you in response to your letter , I was delighted to know that I won the first price .
With reference to the date , I only can go on July , as I 'm going off on holiday on August , and I start university on September .
The place I 'd prefer to stay in is a log cabin , where I 'm sure I 'd feel more confortable than in a tent .
It 's very nice of you to let me choose my favourite activities .
The ones I 'm most keen on are Tennis , in which I think I 'm pretty good since I took some classes last year , and Painting , which is one of my favourite hobbies , and helps me to relax myself and forget about problems .
I think I 'm not bad at painting either , at least everyone in my family likes my work , includying myself .
Anyway , there are some questions I 'd like to ask you : What kind of clothes would be the most suitable for California weather in summer , and how much money do you think I 'll need ?
I 'm waiting forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours sincerely ,
Manela B.
Dear Kim ,
I 'm so sorry I haven't written until now , but you know I 'm always very busy .
As I told you in my last letter , last month I worked for a pop band , and helped them at a concert in Barcelona .
It was such a great experience !
Basically my work was carrying the instruments , the speakers and the lights from the vans to the stage , which is not an easy work because , as you can imagine , it 's not exactly light stuff .
But the most exciting part was meeting the band , mainly the singer and the drummer who are very nice and also good - looking .
Anyway , I had lot of fun working for them .
I hope they call me soon , I 'd be the happiest girl in the world if I could see them again ...
I 'd better leave now .
I hope you write again soon .
Manela B.
Dear Madam
I am very happy to win this prize and I am going to give you some information from me that you need to make me have a good time at Camp California .
I would like to know only in July because I have set my holidays this month since last January .
I want if it is possible a log cabins like accommodation because I have been suffering from my back since my childhood , therefore I need a confortable accommodation .
I will be pleased to swim and paint when I am at the camp .
I selected swimming because it is a cure against my backace and I have not practiced since I started my new job five years ago .
I also choosed painting because I have never done before , I would like to learn and moreover I want to do a calm activity .
Otherwise , could you tell me approximately how much money I have to take for the food , please ?
Yours sincerely .

How many times have we heard people complaining about shopping ?
Sometimes , they are happy to do shopping .
but why ?
Therefore , shopping can be enjoyable but it is not always the case .
Shopping is enjoyable when you want to offer some thing to someone .
In fact you try to get a present to make receive happy .
Shopping is also good , when you know what you want .
For example if you want a new track suit you know that you have to go to a sport shop but if you do n't know what you want you are going to waste your time in the shops .
In the opposite , shopping can be disenjoyable .
Shopping is boring if you go with people too fussy .
That is to say , they are never happy with what they get and see . They always find a problem .
Shopping is not enjoyable with people who just look around the shops .
It is stupid , they do not have any goal .
They waste their time .
To conclude , I agree with shopping is not always enjoyable .
Even if I like to do shopping with some people and kind of shops I will kill myself because I waste my time .
To the manager of the
Circle Theatre in London
I 'm a tourist and I had a week 's holiday in London a few time ago .
I had enjoied to see the musical show that the Circle Theatre presented some night ago ; and the actor 's Danny Brook performance .
I went to the theatre at 19.30 o'clock but , with my surprise , the show started at 20:15 and so I could n't remain here until the end because I left London , with my group before the end of the show .
The star , the actor Danny Brook , there was n't in the musical show but there was an other actor , with my great disappoint .
Then , in the program I could read a discount available for the tickets , for the groups , but I could n't have that . I could n't have all the things I expected .
That evening was terrible for me and for my friends , so I 'm not satisfied about your informations and I ask some money back .
Your Sincerely
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Some days ago , when the school was ending , Pat and her friends decided to make a party for their friend , Frances , because the end of the school and the Francis 's birthday were the same day .
That might be a secret for Francis - and they decided the program and the present , a new gold watch .
Peter and Sue asked to Francis some help for their exam 's subjets and Francis , for to help them , was very busy all the week .
The last day all the friends went to Pat 's home with food , musical instruments , tape recorder .
Pat was very excited about this .
In the afternoon she had phoned at a Francis 's mother and she explained her the secret , then she phoned at her best friend and she speak about that too ; she phoned at many people all the day .
Now many people knew the secret but Pat said everyone : " I tell you a small secret , but you do n't speak , please ! "
In the night Francis was invited to the party , at Pat 's home .
When he was out he needed to buy some cigarettes so he went to the shop where the owner , a his friend , ask him if he was very happy about his present , the new gold watch , he was very lucky to have best friends like Pat and her friends .
The Francis 's secret was discovered !
Now all the Pat 's friend do n't tell her about their secrets because Pat is n't very good at keeping secrets .
Dear Sir ,
I went to your show called " Over The Rainbow " and I was really disappointing in many points .
Firstly , you spoke about two actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , instead of them we had two others and they were really bad .
So I was really surprised .
In addition to this you started the show 45 minutes late .
It was boring for everybody .
How could we appreciate the show properly .
Moreover , in your advert you spoke about discounts available but it was not the case .
No discounts were available .
Then you offered people to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because there is no staff to welcome the people .
You offered something impossible to do .
I did not have a good time for all of this reasons and I would like you to give my money back .
I hope your understand my request and you are going to reply as soon as possible .
Thank you .
yours sincerely
O. Labro
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I though she was a really good friend but I made a mistake .
She could n't keep my secret and everybody knew which boy I was in love with .
She did n't tell me yet but when I came in class everybody was looking at me and this boy as well .
I looked at her and she became pale and suddently left the class .
I followed her and caught her to push her on the ground .
I was ready to fight but somebody stopped me .
I could n't go back to the class so I went home .
My Mum was at home and I told her all the story .
She said that I had to be strong and did n't care about them .
So I went to the class and everybody was laughing at me and the boy told them to stopped because he loved me and wanted to be with me .
At this time all the girls became jealous and stopped to laugh .
Dear Mr Robertson .
It is a pleasure to write to you and we want to thanks for organising a school trip to London .
We have seen the programme list and we all think it will be enjoyable .
Especially to the science museum because we all doing science in school .
Recently , some students have seen an advertisment about a fashion and leisure show in London . it will be on the 14th and we all want to go .
So , it would be greatful if you can give us this opportunity to watch the show .
This is a great opportunity to learn something else because most of us have not been to this kind of show And it is free for students . it will be incredible if we have a chance to watch the show .
So could you give us permission to go ?
We also can suggest how the originally programme can be changed .
We will have free time on Wednesday afternoon .
So we can do shopping instead .
We are all looking forward for you answer .
faithful

It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
Because there was a man had a serious car accident and I was walking pass him .
Nobody had noticed him because it happened at night and the car had actually crashed into the bushes .
I was thinking ' what should I do ? ' I haven't got my mobile phone with me And I was half way between my school and home .
At that time he was unconcious , I kept asking myself ' should I wake him up or try to use my unsure first aid skill to deal with him .
I was struggling because I knew if I did n't help him , he would die in a short time .
I decided to do something to this man , my first move was to check was there any solid or liquid which could blocked his breathe .
And checking his body condition .
After that I turned on the car light in order to tell the passing cars .
I ran back home for help .
I phoned to police And told the whole story .
The strange thing happened to me , when I got back to that man .
The car and the man were not there anymore .
Where could they be ?
I was wondering .
Oh , sorry they were not in this road , they were in the next road .
Dear Madam :
I just receive your letter with the good news .
I am very happy for winning the first prize in your competition and I am glad to tell you that I am planning to go but I can only travel on July because I have to work until the end of June .
For the accommodation I would like to have log cabins rather than tents because two weeks is quite a long time and I think they are more comfortable and give you more privacy .
I enjoy swimming and singing and I would like to join others in these activities .
I am an average swimmer and as a singer I am not a start but it would be fun to share my songs with the holiday makers .
Can you please give me some recomendations about the clothes I will need and also the cost of the food there to make my budget .
Thank you for these wonderful two weeks at Camp California .
Yours faithfully
Shopping is not always enjoyable
In my opinion shopping sometimes is really boring specially when you buy at the supermarkets almost all the time the same things like cleaning products and the ingredients for every day food .
On the other hand everything looks different if I have to make a present for someone in my family .
I start thinking what she or he prefer and I try my best buying something apropiate does n't matter how much money does it cost .
In conclusion most of the time that you spend shopping you put a lot of effort choosing things and making decissions and they are more or less important , or more or less enjoyable depends on what , why , where and who is the person that you are interested to please .

MAY 29 , 1997 .
IT WAS MY FIRST TIME IN LONDON .
THAT NIGHT I WENT TO A PUB IN BAYSWATER .
WHEN THEY CLOSED I TOOK THE 7 BUS .
I WAS LIVING QUITE CLOUSE TO PORTOBELLO ROAD BUT I DIDN'T KNOW VERY WELL THE AREA BECAUSE ALL TIME I JUST HAD TO GET OFF IN THE COURNER OF MY HOUSE . BUT THAT DAY , LIKE I WAS KIND OF DRUNK , I DIDN'T REALISE THAT THE BUS TOOK A DIFFERENT WAY ; SO WHEN I NOTICED IT THE DRIVER WAS ALREADY ASKING ME TO GET OFF , BECAUSE WE WHERE IN THE GARAGE IN PORTOBELLO .
I TOLD HIM , I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS BUT HE JUST SEID SORRY .
I WAS REALY SCARE .
THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE AROUN BUT I WAS AFRAID TO ASK THEM THE WAY I SHOULD TAKE .
AT LEAST I ASKED A BOY AND HE SAID " I'LL TELL YOU WHERE IS THE PLACE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR , JUST FOLLOW ME " .
IT WAS DANGEROUS , BUT I KNEW I HAD TO DO IT .
10 MINUTES AFTER I WAS FOLLOWING HIM , I START KNOWING THE PLACE , AND I WAS FELLING MORE CONFORTABLE .
HE TOOK ME RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE .
I THANK HIM SO MUCH , AND I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I ASKED TO THE RIGHT PERSON AND NOTHING WRON HAPPEN TO ME .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing in order to explain to you the problems regarding the musical show I saw at your theatre .
First of all , there was written in the advertisement for the show , that there would be Danny Brook as main actor , but a different actor played in the show .
The show started forty - five minutes later and this really disappointed me .
Besides , when I bought the ticket , I found out there was not discounts for ticket , while you wrote the contrary .
Moreover , I could not go to the theatre restaurant because , by the time the show had finished , it had already closed .
Definetely , it was a very disappointing evening and I would appreciate your if it was possible to have my money back .
I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future .
Yours faithfully ,
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
She was a very pretty and kind girl , but she had this bad habit .
This was her only fault .
She had a lot of friends but nobody trusted her .
That was why she decide to change her behaviour .
She was given a chance : if she had been able not to tell everybody a secret for a short time , her friends would have started trusting her .
The secret was about a surprise - party for her bestfriend 's birthday .
As soon as the arrangement for the party started , she began to feel nervous and anxious because she wanted to tell everything to her bestfriend .
But , as the days went by , she was surprised because she realized she was getting used not to tell secrets any more .
The day of the party arrived and Pat succeeded in keeping the secret .
All her friends were amazed at her change and started trusting her at once .
17th June 2000
Dear Sir !
I am writing this letter to you , because the show " Over The Rainbow " which is the London 's newest and best musical show , was not ... for me .
Pleas apologise me , but there were many mistakes and problems on the note you have made , which disappointed me very .
I thought that Dany Brook who is my favorite actor play in that show .
And I was really disappointed when I saw Jeremy Brook on the stage .
Please , if you would be so kind and mind correct this mistake . I would be gratefull if you could correct too that show start at 20.15 not on 19.30 .
Other thing was that there was no discounts available , and that the restaurant which I wanted to visit after the show was closed because of the main cooker sikness .
I would be very grateful if I could get my money back .
That evening which should be my perfect evening out , was in fact very tireing and boring .
I am looking forward for answer !
Best regardes !
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , I knew that he 's very talkative person , but it was nessesery because I wanted him to be the main director of that birthday party for tenes .
It started a week before that day .
Pat found the great place for the party called " Blue Box " .
I made a beautifull invite cards for every Agatha friends with a sign " Do not tell Agatha about that , this is a suprise party for her , please keep the secret ! " Pat arranged great DJ and drinks .
My friend and I made a perfect decoration with ballons and other party stuff .
Everyone told us it was breath taking .
Everything was set ... the day and hour came .
Everyone gathered in disco at 21.00 .
We were only waiting for Agatha who should come at 22 o'clock with her boyfriend .
It was so exaiting ! ! !
We put off the lights and then the door opened and I just heard " What the hell is going on ? ! ! "
She entered the room , and everyone shouted HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR !
She was so touched that we started to cry .
Enyway the disco was great , music also .
We had fun to 5 o'clock !
Agatha said that it was the greatest present she could ever get !
Dear Mr / Mrs ,
I 've seen your festival and I would like to give you my suggestions to it .
I must say that International Arts Festival is really great idea .
And your last festival was very intresting too .
But also there are some notes that you should improve in the next year 's festival to make it absolutelly wonderful .
First of all , you must invite artists and stars from more countries around the world , because there are people only from six countries .
I think it can make your festival more popular .
Jazz , rock and classical concerts are amazing , but I think that some concert halls are too small , so not everybody can come .
Your dance shows are very beautiful , art exhibitions is something original and exciting .
And also it is very interesting to talk with writers .
I think that one reasonably - priced weekend for all events is exellent idea because it is n't so Expensive as buying ticket to each event , and with this ticket you can visit everything you want .
I hope you will continue to making your festivals .
Your faithfully ,
Dear Tom ,
How are you ?
Thank you for your last letter .
It was very interesting .
The question you asked me in it is very original too .
I must say that rules are n't same in schools of our country .
Every school has it 's own rules .
I think that my school is very democratic and so there are very good relations between teachers and students .
We are all very friendly in our class and we help to each other when we have a problem .
So the main rule in our school is regarding theachers .
I 'm allowed to do many things at home .
My parents are very kind , and they know that their son will do everything right .
And the main reason Why our family is so friendly , it 's because we haven't go many rules .
So , I think there is n't something I 'd like to change .
I hope everything is good in your family and your school .
Take care ,
13th June 2000
Dear Mrs Ryan

1 . What kind of clothes are needed ?
2 . What I have to pay by myself ?
3 .
Should I take some money with me ?
4 .
How is the wheather in California ?

Shopping is not always enjoyable
Most of the time is shopping fun and enjoyable .
There are a lot of reasons that could be awful to go shopping .
Even if you run out of money or you have to buy a particular thing which is difficult to find .
I had once this problem .
I was looking for a special fruit .
The sales assistants in the stores are n't so nice and helpful .
Sometimes they give me a bad feeling as , , customer treat with order " .
Last week I was shopping with my younger brother . Awful .
He wanted everything what his eyes saw .
All the stuff for children are in the same level as they have their eyes .
Afterwards , I felt tired and unsatisfy the store .
The shops have bad opening times .
When I feel me comfortable for shopping everything will be closed or you haven't enough time to look around .
My conclusion on these points are not so bad . I like shopping at all with my best friend .
Dear Mrs Ryan !
I 'm very happy that I won first prize in your competion .
Two weeks at California in the USA is the thing about I dreamed a lot .
You asked me few questions in your letter .
I would like to answer .
The only one term for me to visit you is July .
I can come to USA on July becouse on August I will be working with my father .
We are building a new house for our family .
What about accommodation , I prefer tents to log cabins .
Nights in hol . on July are hot .
Tent will be more cooler to sleep then the cabin .
You offer a great veriety of activities .
My best sports disciplines are swimming and basketball .
I am a life guard and I could work in your camp as a rescuer next summer .
Basketball is the game which I love .
I always watch the NBA matches on T.V. It will be great for me to train basketball in USA .
I have qustions to .
How much money should I take with me and what sort of clothes are requested
Thank You .
Yours sincerely K.
Shoping is not always enjoyable .
Ten or fifteen years ago we had in Poland empty shelves in shops .
We could only buy things from Russia .
People alwas queued for stuff from west .
If you had wanted something special for example for a gift you had to stay in a line all night .
It was the worst side of shopping in Poland couple years ago .
Nowadays we have capitalism , free market lots of privete shops , markets and super - markets .
We can buy everything what about we imagine .
Polish super market are not Polish origin shops .
They are imported from enother Western Europe country .
I apprieciate this shops for lots of products , cheep prices end big spaces .
But the problem is when I want to buy only one thing , for example bread .
On Friedy evening and at on the weekdays each supermarkets are crowded .
They are filled by people who went buy everything .
I do not like crowded places .
This is the reason why I do not like shopping .
Dear Mrs Ryan ,
I am writing in reply to your letter in which you communicate I have won first prize in your competion .
I am glad .
Thank you very much .
Now I am answering your questions and then I would like to know further information about travel and accomodation .
I would like to travel in July because in June I am going to take some exams at University and at the moment I do not know the exact date .
I can tell you I am only free in July .
I would prefer an accomodation in log cabins because I am not keen on tents and I think that a log cabin is more comfortable than a tent .
As regard as the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp I would like to practise painting and photography .
I am a painter in oils from life and my subjects are landscapes , people , animals .
I like also taking photographs , for example during my journeys or trips .
So when I go back home I can use my best pictures to reproduce them as a painting .
Would you give me some information about clothes to wear there ?
I would like also to know how much money I can bring .
Looking forward to hearing from you
Yours sincerely ,
Billy Esposito
There is somebody who says that ' Shopping is not always enjoyable ' and who is happy only when can go shopping .
In the first I do not think that shopping is enjoyable when you must do so in a hurry or for duty .
If you have to run from one shop to another and always looking at the watch , doing shopping is a terrible activity .
On the other hand if you can walk without anytime problem with a good friend I think that shopping is very enjoyable .
For istance , it is funny enter a clothes shop and try on a skirt or a t - shirt although you do not buy anything .
To sum up I enjoy wasting money and buying useful things or not .
I often like getting gifts for my relatives and friends .
In my opinion , shopping is relaxing above all on Saturdays when you have finished a work week and you are expecting a wonderful Sunday .
DEAR MS .
RYAN ,
IN REFERENCE TO YOUR LETTER DATED 28 MAY I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR INFORMING ME ABOUT THE COMPETITION RESULT .
I AM VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT I AM THE WONNER OF THE COMPETITION ORGANISED BY YOUR COMPANY LAST MONTH .
IT IS VERY PLEASED TO KNOW THAT I HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEND TWO WEEKS AT CAMP CALIFORNIA IN THE USA , WHERE I HAVE NEVER BEEN BEFORE .
ACCORDING TO YOUR REQUIREMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS REGARDING TRAVEL TIME , ACCOMMODATION 'S PREFERENCES AND ACTIVITIES WHICH I LIKE TO DO .
ANSWERING THE FIRST QUESTION - I WOULD LIKE TO TRAVEL IN JULY .
THE REASON IS I AM WORKING FOR THE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANY AS A MARKETING SPECIALIST AND WE ARE PREPARING FOR THE BIGGEST TELECOMMUNICATION FAIR IN THE WORLD WHICH IS TAKING PLACE IN SEPTEMBER .
WE WILL BE WORKING ON THIS WHOLE AUGUST SO THE ONLY ONE VACATION MONTH I CAN GO IS JULY .
CONCERNING THE ACCOMMODATION - PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT I WOULD PREFER THE LOG CABIN AS IN THE MEANTIME I SHOULD WORK ON MY LAPTOP , PREPARING SOME FINANCIAL REPORTS SO THE ELECTRICITY WILL BE NEEDED . I THINK THAT THE LOG CABIN WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE AT ALL . REGARDING TWO ACTIVITIES - I HAVE CHOOSEN TENNIS AND PHOTOGRAPHY .
I JUST STARTED TO PLAY TENNIS THAT IS WHY I THINK IT WOULD BE A POSSIBILITY TO PRACTISE AND CHECK MY SKILLS .
PHOTOGRAPHY IS MY HOBBY .
SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE .
PEOPLE LIKE DOING SHOPPING ( ASPECIALLY IN POLAND , WHERE MANY NEW AND MODERN SUPERMARKETS HAVE BEEN OPENED ) LADIES PREFER TO VISIT UNDERWEAR SHOPS OR DEPARTMENTS IN HUGE HIPERMARKETS AND MEN ARE HAPPY WHEN THEY CAN BUY SOMETHING NEW FOR THEIR CARS , MOTORS OR COMPUTERS .
PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD LIKE GOING TO DO SHOPPING WITH FRIENDS OF FAMILIES ( IT 'S EASIER TO CHOOSE THE REALLY NEEDED THINGS FOR KITCHEN OR BATHROOM , TO GET SOMETHING TASTY FOR DINNER , LUNCH OR BREAKFAST ) .
BUT SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE DOING SHOPPING AT ALL .
THE REASONS ARE ; DISTANCE , LACK OF CAR , CROWDED STREETS , TRAFFIC ON THE WAY TO THE SHOP .
THEY CAN SAY , , SHOPPING IS NOT ENJOYABLE '' BECAUSE THEY PREFER TO ORDER CLOTHES AND FOOD IN CATALOGUES OR IN THE PIZZA HUT RESTAURANT SITUATED ON THE CORNER .
THEY ARE TOO LAZY FOR WALKING AND LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NICE FOR BIRTHDAY PRESENT OR FLOWERS FOR GIRL - FRIENDS .
ON THE OTHER HAND - IT 'S VERY COMFORTABLE TO SEAT AT HOME , CALL AND WAIT FOR THE ORDER REALISATION .
PEOPLE , WHO DON'T LIKE SHOPPING HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS OF THIS SITUATIONS ( MAYBE THEY HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH A RUDE SHOP - ASSISTANCE , BOUGHT NOT FRESH FOOD ONE DAY AND DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT ANY MORE , HAD BAD EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN SHOPS ) .
THEY DON'T LIKE SHOPPING EITHER BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER ( SOMETIMES IT 'S TOO HOT OR TOO COLD FOR GOING OUTSIDE ) .
ANYHOW EVERYBODY SHOUD DO SHOPPING AS PEOPLE NEED TO EAT , NEED CLOTHES AND MANY OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS TO LIVE .
EVEN IF THE SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE PEOPLE HAVE TO BUY THINGS ( AND SPEND MONEY ) .
BUT EVERY INDIVIDUAL CAN CHOOSE THE WAY HOW TO DO IT .
IT ABSOLUTELY DEPENDS ON A LIFE - STYLE , PERSONALITY AND NEEDS .
Dear Helen ,
Thanks you very much for your recent letter .
I can not believe that I won the first prize ( It 's great ! ) and of course , I am very happy .
As your questions , I am free to travel only on July because I will having my holiday after finished the exams .
And , I have to returned to my university by August .
I prefer to stay in log cabin rather than in tent because I am not used to with narrow space and feel more comfortable with a place like bedroom .
Furthermore , I prefer to do painting and photography as my hobbies and my fasinative in art and enjoyed to take a photograph of wildlife .
Finally , please could you give me an idea what sort of clothes to bring ? and how much would be spend there .
Also , please advice for any necessary things to prepare and bring .
I looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Kim ,
Sorry for I haven't written to you for such a long time , but I 've got a good excute !
It was a big one that I never thougth and I could n't imagine how amazing was it .
I did n't know what is my responsible until they called me to trained .
What a surprised ! and unbelieveable , I was responsible for looking after the pop stars .
You might understand how excited I was .
But , I 've got though it . I have to taken care of them during a break , served a drink , clothes , even brought them some cigaratte and anything they wants .
I think they are so hospitality and warm with people around them . You know ! because of these are change all my opinions about self - important behavior of superstar .
The most appreciated was they 've given me their latate CD with signature . Marvellous thing ! and of couse as you have seen it I 've given one to you .
I hope you 're well and enjoyed with CD and do n't forget to write back all about your news during my summer holiday job .
Love ,
Dear Mr ,
I am a foreign student who is on holidays here .
I am going to stay here a week .
I went to your theatre three days ago and it was horrible .
I 'm sorry but I am very dissapointed with the musical show .
I would like to explain you my experience because I want you to give my money back .
The last Monday , I went to the theatre with two friends .
We arrived on time but the musical show was delayed untill half - pass eight .
Moreover , we had n't any disscount for beeing students .
On the other hand , the main actor was changed for another and nobody told us .
When there was a restful we went to the restaurant which was closed because it was late .
We could n't have a drink .
Well I believe that it was a bad day but I would like you to give my money back because on the advertisement there was some things that we had n't in the theatre .
Finally , it would be grateful if you could answer me soon .
Yous sincerelly ,
Our lives are changing .
When I was a child I had different entertainments that the actually children had n't .
We could play with our toys , dolls and we could enjoy without a computer .
We had n't so many machines than they have .
The technology is growing and growing .
If you have a computer you will be able to have all the information that you want .
It 's very important but some times it is a wrong thing because the children can see it too .
Moreover you can change the TV programme without getting up .
We can find information about the weather , sports on our TV - text .
On the other hand , the science is changing .
We have more researchers than some years ago and we will be able to find the solution of lots of problems .
Actually , we can cure illness which were very dangerous before .
I 'm sure that in a couple of years we will see cured some illness like cancer , UTH .
The new technology is changing our lives .
Dear Madam ,
I 'm writing to You in order to express my feelings about the International Arts Festival .
I spent two days there , and I think it was the best Arts Festival I have ever been at .
I also hope , that the festival could be even better next year .
The great idea of making it " international " was unfortunately not brought to life , because the artists ( mentioned to be " from around the world " ) were from only six countries .
Maybe the eason for that is very simple : lack of money ?
It would explain , why some concert halls were simply too small - you just could n't afford bigger ones .
On the other hand , the wide range of plays and films to choose impressed me most .
I thank you for organizing it , and hope to see more next year .
I also thank you for the excellent idea of one ticket for all events , which allowed me to see all the things I was interested in .
My suggestion for next year 's festival is simple - please make it a few days longer !
Yours faithfully ,
Dear Friend ,
Thank you for your last letter - I was very pleased to receive it .
If you really want to hear about school rules in my country , I 'll try to write about them in a nutshell .
We do not have many school rules , and the teachers are rather liberal .
We do n't have to wear any special uniforms on signs of our school .
Some rules are really simple : we must be at school on time , and we must not disturb others during the classes .
We are not allowed to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol of course !
In winters we are to change our shoes .
It may sound funny , but mud , gravel and snow lying on the school 's floors is not a nice sight , so we change our schoes without questioning that rule .
I am also used to write exams which are in polish schools very often .
At home I do n't have many rules either .
I must wash the dishes from time to time ( I sometimes try to avoid this unpleasant duty ) and clean our house .
I do n't think there is anything I 'd like to change .
I 'm very pleased with my situation and I hope you are pleased with yours !
Your faithfully ,
Dear Ms Helen Ryan
I write to find out further information and give you some details about myself and the travel that I have won in your competition .
First of all , I would like to inform you that I am able to travel only in July . Because , I am a student and in June , I will still have school .
Also , in Augost I will be studying a summer English course .
In addition , I would prefer to stay in a tent .
Because I would like to stay somewhere which differs from my home and every days comforts , in these two weeks .
However , in your letter is written some activities . I would choose Basketball and Tennis .
Basketball I have been playing in a team , of my town for ten years .
Also Tennis is my favourite hobby and I play twice every week with my friends .
Finally , I would be grateful to you , if you told me about clothes and money .
Will we need any special clothes and How much you would suggest me to carry for these two weeks ?
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely
Dear Kim
How are you ?
I am very well I 'm writing to explain my experience with the pop concert ; last month .
First of all , I think that I help them .
Every day of that month I was trying to advertise this concert .
I was going to markets to schools and I was giving information when and where the group was going to appear as well as where can they buy or book a ticket for this concert .
I know , It was difficult and tired but I enjoyed a lot .
Firstly , it was a good break from the routine .
Because I did it for first time .
Also , I felt wonderful when I saw , that the concert had succesed and every day was croweded .
Because I believed that this was a result which came with my help .
I would like to do again it in the future .
It was a fantastic experience .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
Best wishes
Dear Mr Robertson ,
I 'm writing to you to thank you for the programme you have organised .
All students are very pleased and we are looking forward to go to London .
We know we are going for three days , but we 'll have enough time to use one of the bigger city in the world .
London is the place to be when always something happening .
We all very happy with your programme , especially we like the idea of sightseeing by our and National Art Gallery .
The students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show , we would like to ask you if is possible to make some changes in the programme ?
The show is on Tuesday the 14th between 10.00- 13.00 .
We think is the great opportunity to see latest fashion , find about make up and hairstyles .
And all of it is free ,
According to your programme we have the science Museum which is in the morning and then shopping .
Would it be possible to go to the Museum and then for the shopping in our free time which is on Wednesday ?
All students will be very greatful .
your sincerly
I think for all of us home is something which is a very important .
Home sweet home .
We call home the place where we live or the country where we come frome .
Anyway home is always the place to go because is ours we feel save and comfortable .
Home sweet home .
After hard work we want to go home to have our corner where we are all able to rest and relax .
I think in the future home might be just the place to go to sleep .
We live in the very busy world !
Working long hours , doing plenty of activieties , going out , going on holidays .
We even do n't spend time with families .
Propably in the future we might be to busy to go to our own home and spend some time there .
But in the end of the day it alway will be place to go ! We find our family there and our life .
Some of us have been living in one house since they were born .
We are sentimental and we have memory from the past . I think it 's a part of our life.lf
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing to complain about the musical show .
Over the Rainbow , which you advertised .
I saw the show at your theatre with my friend on 6th June .
First of all , I would like to have seen Danny Brook as I am keen on his play .
He did not play in the evening .
It made me sad .
Secondly , the starting time has been changed from 19:30 to 20:15 .
We waited for ages because we had not been informed .
In addition , although you advertised the discounts tickets available , they do not sale them any more according to your staff .
Finally , we went to the restaurant in your theater after the show .
It was closed because of the staff trainning .
I am sure you can understand my disappointment . I must insist that you refund the cost of the show .
Unless I hear from you within ten days , I shall have to take legal advice on the matter .
I look forward to hearing from you in the near future .
Yours faithfully ,
It is believed that our life style has been changed by mordern technology such as computers and washing machine etc .
Especially for families .
I have found very expensive to buy them but there are number of advantages .
First of all , dishwashers are very effecient for me because I work full time and look after my children .
It is very difficult to cook and wash dishes after working .
Before buying my dishwasher I asked my son to wash them .
He complained about a lot .
Secondly , computers are useful for us as well , because we do not need to go somewhere if we want to have information , for example traveling .
However my family 's members do less communicate with each other than we used to , because my children are keen on playing computer games .
In my opinion , the morden technology make our life style combinient .
It is very good for us but I think we should think about more carefully when we buy something for our children .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I 'm writing to complain about my horrible evening at The Circle Theatre on 10th June 2000 .
Last week I was on holiday in London and I went to the theatre for entertaining but I wish I 'd not go there because everythings went wrong .
I bought a ticket at the box office but there were not any discounts for student like you said in the advertisement for the show and also the show had to start at 19.30 but on that day it delaied about 45 minutes .
During the show I was expected to meet Danny Brook who is my favourite actor and Tina Truelove .
There are Robert Alan and Jack Ruby instead of them .
It really disappointed me .
After finishing the show I wanted to visit your restaurant and I found that it was closed .
It was a sign in front of the restaurant " sorry we closed because special reasons " and I was wondering what was the reasons for that .
Finally I would like to have refund for my ticket back because it was horrible evening .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours faithfully ,
Paya Chuaswee ( Miss )
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets that why our great plan for horiday were not be real .
It happened in last summer we planed to go on holiday in the Southen part of Thailand by motorbike but we could n't tell our parents because they would n't allow us to go .
We started our journey and we arrived at our purpose place by 6 o'clock in the evening .
The sun was shining and wind were breezing like we had imaged .
Whlile I was standing on the beach suddenly I heard someone called my name and said that I had to go home , that right , she is my mum .
She told me Pat had phoned her while we were going and my mum followed us because it was so dangerous to went by bicycle .
Eventhrough we could spend our holiday there but with my mum and I just found that it was fantasy time which I had never though about it .
From now on I do n't want to tell something secrets to Pat because she always tell someone else but she still my best friend .

Dear Ms Ryan
I am writing in reply to your letter I received yestarday .
I am very proud that I won first prize in your competition and I am extremely happy to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
At the beginning I would like to answer questions you asked me in your letter .
The most appropriate month for me to travel is July because my boss promised to give me this month off ( I am in charge of project which starts in June so I am sure I could n't go later ) .
' As I have a choise I would prefer to stay in log cabins to tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so depended on weather conditions .
As I was requested I should choose two activities from the list .
So I decided to choose climbing and photography .
These two are easy to connect , I could climb and make pictures at the same time .
I am very keen on photography .
Last year I took part in photograher 's contest and I won a second prize in Poland in cathegory of , , beautiful scenery '' .
Climbing , in contrast , is something I started few months ago , so I have not gained any success in this sport .
But you could give me a chance to get more familier with it .
I would like to ask about clothes .
Do I need any formal ones ?
I would like also to know what the cost of spending two weeks in the U.S.A. is .
I want to thank you ones more for taking me into consideration in your competition .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely
Juliana Piotrowska
Have you ever been to a big supermarket and tried to find something you really like or want , looking throug shelves and not finding that in the end .
What did you feel ?
You had to be disappointed .
There is a lot of situations which could make you feel similar while you do shopping .
You might spend too much money and buy something you do n't really need .
You could also buy something which later turns out to be out of order .
So you have to complain about it .
Very often a shop assistant is not helpful so you lose your money and your time .
Moreover , you could face an agressive and maybe even drunk shop assistant or manager .
This leads to an escalation of your anger .
Sometimes you could find a bargain .
You are happy to buy a dress or a suit for a good price .
But at home you noticed that there is a tear on sleeve .
And you could n't of course give it back because the price was lowered and your dress is not under guarantee .
You could also face an unpleasant situation connected with money .
Somebody could give you not enough change .
How would you feel ? Deceived ?
So if you do n't want to feel deceived or offended , think twice before you decide to go shopping .
( A very depressing point of view , is n't it ? )
Dear Sir ,
I would like to complain about the show which you presented on last saturday .
It was such disappointing evening out with my friend during our a week 's holiday in London .
We have had a quite pleasant time except the evening .
Actually it spoiled our time .
So I would like to get back our money .
These are some points I want mention about the differencies between the advertisement said and the realities .
First , I had a great expectation to see Danny Brook plays his role , but he had never shown up that night .
The main actor was an unknown actor .
It was a such disappointing .
Second , it started only at 20:15 .
It was 45 minutes later than it suppose to be .
It was a such boaring to wait the show in a noisy and hot theatre .
Third , there was no possibility of discount .
The girl sold the tickets was laughing at me when I mention about the discounts availability was written in the advertisement .
Forth , the theatre restaurant was closed .
There was a not on the door saying that the painting was going on the weekend .
How could you arrange work like that ?
Finally the sentence was written blow down on the advertisement was absolutely not true .
It was most imperfect evening out I ever exprienced .
I wish that you can provide a better service next time , and this time you need give back the money we paid .
Sincerely
Yu Phu Tung .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Since I moved to London to study English I have had a hard time to make intimate friendship with people around me .
First it was because of the culture difference .
It took quite long time to adjust in the multi culture in the language institue .
Secondly the language ability was another issue .
Even I could meet some friend , but I could n't express my heat to them for we have different back ground and our first language were different .
I really wished to have a friend can share everything is going in our lives .
Finally I met Pat .
She was a such wonderful person in our class .
She tried to help others when they have difficult time at school .
One day she realized that I was always been outside of circle .
One day she invited me to her flat .
Since then we have visited each other often and spent time together in weekend usally .
We had a fantastic time together for three monthes .
Even we could make a trip to Paris in the school holiday !
We had many common interests in music , art and books .
I thought that I found a good friend in my life .
So I told her everything about my life .
There were some stories I never told anyone before , but I had share with her all my secrets .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Few days later I told her about my secret love story , it became a top gossip among my classmate .
It was a nightmare !
Dear Sir / madam ,
Thank you for your letter and your congratulations .
I never thought that I would win the competition .
It is really wonderful .
I can stay at Camp California in the U.S.A. for two weeks .
I am a student at Portsmouth College and the end of this term is 23 June , so I can only travel in July .
I wonder if it is all right for that time .
And for my accommodation .
I prefer live in a log cabin , because it is more comfortable .
I like to relax there and enjoy the atmosphere when I live in .
I like to do some activities in water and my favourite activity is swimming .
Before I came England , I swam every weekend in my country even in winter , so I choose to do some swimming and sailing while I am at the camp .
Actually , my mind has already gone there , I ca n't wait even for a minute .
I want to go there now .
By the way , I would like to know the shopping especially for clothes , I want to buy some for myself .
And do you think I need to exchange money before I go there ?
I look forward to your letter .
Yours faithfully ,

Subject : About daily life at our school
Introduction
What do students do now ?
Lots of student normally have classes in the morning .
And sometimes they do something in the library by themselves in the afteroon .
For instance , reading , looking for some information or using computer .
What do they think about it ?
The arts students want to learn another foreign language .
Moreover , some foreign students hope there will be some English classes that aim to the examination .
Most of them want to do more activities in the afternoon .
Recommendations
Open some foreign language classes at part - time for the students who is interested in it .
Let foreign students do more excises about English to help them pass the exam .
Using the equipment and area what we have to organise some activities .
Dear Mrs Ryan ,
I am writting to thank you for your letter confirming the first prize that I won in your competition .
I would like also with the present to give you some information about me in order to arrange the details for the trip .
First of all , I would like to inform you that I will be able to travel only during July because in June I am going to give examinations for the First Certificate in English .
Furthermore , in August I will be preparing for my course at the University which I am starting next September .
Secondly , I would be grateful if you could arrange for me accomodation in log cabins as I am not used on living in the countryside and especially in tents .
In addition , I would like to inform you that I prefer to do Surfing and Sailing while I will be at the Camp , as I am an active member of Sailing and Surfing Club of Manchester and it will be a great chance for me to practise my techniques and skills .
I would be also grateful if you could send me information about the average living cost at California as I have to arrange the amount of money that I am going to spend , and some advice about the clothes that I need .
I would like also to specify if the food is including in the prize .
Please let me know if you need more information .
Yours sincerely
As requested , I visited some classes during the lesson and some other rooms while activities were taking place .
The aim of this report is make a series of suggestions on which lessons and other activities should be filmed .
It 's seems to me that it will be an extremely good advertisement for our school if you take plans from the lesson of Chemistry in the laboratory , because our laboratory is new , recognised as one of the best in the area as it has a huge amount of instruments and really some very good professors , and also many experiments are taking place in this laboratory
Furthermore , I think it will be a good idea to take plans from a match of our school team in the football field as it is completely new and full equiped .
In addition , I think you have to take also plans from the school 's Nursery as there are a lot of facilities for the children , and the parents can recognise that the teachers are very good .
I think also that will be a good idea to take some general plans of the school area as there is a huge background .
In conclusion , I have to declare that my myself and my fellow students will be available to help to this short video by all means .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am delightful to receive your letter saying that I have won a two - week holiday in your recent competition and it will all paid in advance .
I am writing this letter so as to give you the information which will help you organize all the necessary details of the forthcoming holiday .
I would be grateful if you could arrange a date after the 20th of July , due to the problems beyond my control .
Otherwise I will not be able to travel abroad .
I would rather stay in one of the log cabins as I am allergic to many plants and insects and I should avoid contacting them .
It is wonderful to hear that there is a good variety of activities available at the camp .
As I am very interested in photography and swimming I am hoping to take part in them .
I came second last year 's swimming competition and I have enrolled photography classes .
In the camp I can practise them alot .
I was wondering if I need to bring some extra money and thick clothes with me in case there is an emergency .
Could you please let me know as soon as you receive my letter .
Yours faithfully
Dear Kim ,
I am terribly sorry not to drop you a line since the last time we wrote to one another .
But I finally got around writing and you 'll see that it 's definetly worth waiting as I have some great and unbeliavable news to tell you .
As you know I 'm on half - term school holiday and have plenty of time to do much more different things apart from studying my A - level history , such as meeting up my friends , visiting interesting places or even going to the cinema on my own .
However this term has been a far cry from the others .
You will see why I 'm describing it as the most unforgettible one when you read through my letter .
Couple of days ago I bumped into my best friend who is into music and we started to have a chat about what we had both been doing .
She invited me to the rehearsal of a huge consert whose singer was a well - known pop star as well as my favorite .
Can you believe that I was introduced to him and I took numerous photographs some of which I put in the envelope .
It was like a dream come true , and was the best part of the experience in my opinion .
I helped out my friend by writing huge billboards and making some light refreshments .
Despite the fact that I felt exhausted I must admit that it was one of the days I will never forget througout my life
write me soon .
Dear Mr. Robertson ,
The trip that you planned for us , students , it 's a great chance to meet new people and visit a beautiful city like London .
Your programme is excellent because it tries to offer to the students the best way to spend our time without wasting time in silly places or events .
We 'd like to thank you because the kind of happening shows how you are dedicated with our school and the students that study there .
It 's great to visit especially the Science Museum because of its expositions .
But there 's something that I 'd like to ask .
The London fashion and Leisure Show will start on Tuesday .
It 's a great opportunity for us because there will be expositions of the latest fashions , of the new hairstyles , of the new leisure and sports clothes and people teaching how to make up .
Our suggestion is that you could change the day of the leisure time to the shopping in the afternoon .
By this way , the leisure time would be on Tuesday and we would be able to go to the London Fashion .
Thanks for the attention and we 're waiting for your answer .
Yours faithfully ,
Famous People x Media
Famous people are special for the rest of the society .
They form opinions and invent new fashion styles .
Nowadays , the media is expanding its ways of communication so they need more information . The media is starting to get into the private life of these famous people .
It 's important to respect other people lives because it can cause serious problems in the family of the person or in his life .
If the famous person does n't mind in being filmed in his personal life there 's no problem .
But if the politicians or the film stars ask for privacity the media has to respect .
Everybody likes to be with your family without any reporter or photographer .
In summary , the best thing to do is try to extract from these people their best qualities and not try to find things that could irritate them like familiar problems or personal problems .
The respect is essential .
They deserve to have a private life like any common person .
Dear Mr / Mss
I 'm writing you in complain about musical show , that I have visited last evening .
I had a week holiday in London , so I wanted to spend my last evening with great pleasure , however it was the worse evening in my life .
First of all , the actors were different from those who were advertised .
Second , the show started at 20:15 , althoug I read that it started at 19:30 !
More over after watching a show I wanted to visit your theatre restaurant , but it was closed , it really disappointed me .
It was my dream to see Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , so it is still my dream because of your show .
So , I had no perfect evening out and I want my money back .
I hope you 'll understand my situation and if you want other people to visit your show , you should return my money .
Yours faithfuly
How has modern techology changed my daily life .
Fifty years ago people even did n't think that after 2000 years they would have another life .
When Thomas Adison invented an electric light , it was the greatest invention for people of that centure .
And nowadays modern technology can change all our life .
I mean , almost everyone has now a car , a computer , a mobil phone and even an airplane .
My life is changing too .
First of all now I can phone my friends and parents from every place , I can chat with other foreign teenagers with the help of the internet .
Second modern technology helps me in the kitchen .
Coocking became faster with the help of the microwave .
What is more Modern technology prevents different illnesses .
Further more , yesterday I 've heard that every man could fly to the space without any experience , it is great , from my point of view in 2050 year everybody will fly to the space .
On the other hand people can atrophided of all this inventions .
He become lazy because they know that they can seat on the sofa and turn the chances on the TV by pressing a boton .
In conclusion I want to say that inspite of this , I hope that in future we will have more and more new inventions and they will stop our disasters and problems .
Dear Mr Robertson
First of all I would like to thank you for the good programme you organised for our trip to London .
Especially the sightseeing by bus seems to be very interesting .
But we would like to suggest you something : There is a trendy event about the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear ; make up and hairstyles on the 14th of March .
It is called , , The London Fashion and Leisure Show . "
This would be a great opportunity because we are all intrested in clothes , sports and fashion .
I have almost forgotten to mention that it is free for students !
Unfortunately we realised that on the 14th we will already visit the Science Museum .
The show lasts nine hours , from 10.00 - 19.00 , the whole day !
Our question now : Could we go to this show ?
We could maybe change Tuesday 's programme to Wednesday .
We all prefer the show , free time is not so important for us .
Please think about this and give us an answer .
Thanks .
Yours faithfully
Dear Jack
Thanks a lot for your letter .
I am fine but quite busy because I have my German exams .
Therefore I read Agatha Christie 's , , Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie " .
I can really recommend you this book , it is fabulous .
It is also a suitable present for your cousin , I think .
One story is about ten persons who stay together in a hotel on a lonely island .
There is a storm and they can not leave .
Suddenly a murderer happens !
Believe me , you would never guess who the killer is !
There is also Hercule Poirot , the famous detective and he finally solves the mistery .
But I will not tell you more .
You have to read it yourself .
And if your cousin likes crime stories it is a perfect book !
Unfortunately it is quite expensive , £ 32 .
But do not worry about the price because your cousin will love it !
Okay , I hope to have news from you very soon .
Have a good time .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Sir / Madam :
Thank you for telling me that I have won the first prize and now I am writing to tell you the information you have requested .
First of all , I think I would like to travel in July , which will be the only month for me to go .
Because my course wo n't finish until the end of June , and I will have to stay in the college to get ready for the new term .
Then I 'd like to choose the tents for my accommodation when at Camp California .
I think sleeping in a tent is funnier than others .
However , during my stay at Camp , there are two activities I can choose , one of them I will choose Basketball because it is the sport I play most , I and my friend used to win the first place in school - wide match when we was in school .
And the other one , I think painting will be a good idea ; Painting is one of my hobbies and I 've been learning it since I was 5 years old and now I 'm still doing it once I have free time .
Above are all the information you asked , however , here are something I 'd like to know ; first is about the clothes , what kind of clothes I need to take with ?
And another question is what is the prices of things like in there , so that I can make a better buget of my trip .
Look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely
Dear Kim :
Thanks for your last letter ; I knew you would interested at my experience of helping the pop concert last time , now I tell you about it .
The place we worked was a football pitch ; we spent 3 days on setting up the stage , the equitment , and the lights .
In fact , there is nothing very important I did , because we are not the right people to do it .
I only put the speakers in the right places , or helping engieners tested the lights .
But at the brakes and after work , I had a chance to talk with the engieners , and I leant something about setting up the equitment .
The fourth day , the singers and the players have been to there to test .
Then I had a chance to speak with them .
From that , I learnt more about instruments .
Finally , the date of concer came .
After the concer finished successfully , I was happier than ever because the succeed inclueded my work and that was the most enjoyable moment in my life .
Anyway , now I have to stop to finish my homework .
I 'm looking forward to receiving your letter again .
Best wishes .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I 'm writing to complain about the musical show named OVER THE RAINBOW .
Regarding your advertisement , it is the LONDON 'S NEWEST AND BEST MUSICAL SHOW , but I was deeply disappointed at it .
According to your advertisement , the starrings were DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE .
I decided to go to see this show because of its starrings , but at the day I saw it , a different actor played .
He was not DANNY BROOK .
Moreover there was no discount ticket .
They were all sold out .
You should have said they were very few .
I had to buy a £ 20 ticket .
It started at 20:15 , fourty five minutes later !
That 's why I could n't have a dinner at the theatre restaurant after the show .
It had already closed , when the show finished .
I 'd like to ask for a full refund for this awful night .
Could you give me a satisfactory reply as soon as possible .
yours faithfully
Modern technology has changed my life .
Especially , a computer has made my daily life change dramatically .
It is only two or three years since I have used a computer at home , but now I wonder how I can live without it .
I open my e - mail box every night .
When I find a new message , I 'm very happy .
Before using e - mail , I used to write letters and sometime telephon .
However I 've found e - mail is better than them .
Because as soon as I send my message , they can receive it .
In the other word , I can also receive their reply soon .
It 's really useful , when I need quick reply .
Overmore when I send e - mail , I need not worry about the time .
I can send them anytime I like .
Thanks to modern technology , I enjoy chatting with my friend in other countries and my family in Japan almost every day .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing to complain about the show , " Over the Rainbow " which I saw in your theatre last week .
I was really disappointed because the show was far from what I expected .
First of all , I was really expecting to see Danny Brook , my favourite actor .
However , he was not on the stage that day .
Secondally the show started late and I had to wait for 45 minutes without doing anything .
It was a waste of time .
I also thought that there should have been discounts for students , which in fact was not available and I had to pay for normal price .
Furthur more , the restaurant in the theatre was closed after the show because of the delay .
I had to go home without eating a dinner , though I was really hungry .
I have to say that the evening was terrible .
If I had known all of them , I would have changed my plan and could have a better time .
I strongly suggest you should give us right information .
I also would like to claim some refund for the evening .
I hope this matter will receive your prompt attention .
Yours faithfully ,
Fashion in 100 years
If you compare the fashion now with that of 100 years ago , you 'll notice that there are incredably big difference between them .
People have become more informal , casual and practical than before .
But how about the fashion of the future , for example , 100 years from now ?
I think it 'll also be very different from now .
But in which way ?
First of all , people might think more about the function of clothes than the design .
For example , they 'll wear a cloth which protect themselves from air pollution , sunshine etc .
Imagine that all the people have masks on their mouthes and noses like we have sun - glasses , and that all the masks are designers brands , which are made of special material to prevent us from breathing in polluted air .
It 's like a joke , but a bit scarely .
Imagine that all the people have hats with big edges to protect their faces from sun - burn , and it 's the most trendy fashion of the year !
It 's funny .
But we never know ! !
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I recently had a holiday in London and had been to your musical show ' Over the Rainbow ' but found it very disappointing .
It is said that the singers are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove in the advertisement .
However , there was a different unknown actor in that .
The show started later at 20:15 which was very different in ' 19.30 ' as shown .
There was no discount at all which is in contrast with ' Discounts Availabe ' .
After the show , I wanted to have something in the theatre restaurant and found it was closed because of no reason .
The real show on it owns is really very different to what are mentioned in the advertisement .
I am unsatisfied and would like to ask for some money back .
Please would you also change the advertisement to the level of the actual facts .
Thank you for your attention .
Yours faithfully ,
What will clothes be like 100 years from now ?
It is a very hard thing to predict .
The fashion of nowaday clothings is just keep on changing .
Although some may appears again after few years different styles are developed .
For the fashion of the future , I think it depends on the people 's own personalities and develope their own styles which suits them the most .
They can wear different kinds of clothing , like they design for themselves or those like history can wear those of victorian time and in different countries .
For the colours , I think the metalic colours , especially silver , will be the most popular .
As different kinds of farbics will be invented & the clothings will never be just cotton as always been seen .
Maybe paper can also be a farbic use for make clothings and for those who like to wear new clothes everyday .
They can be thrown away after wearing it and light enough to be carried around whenever you want to change your wearing .
Dear Mrs. Ryan .
I 'm glad to receive your letter .
I 'm very happy to know that I have won the first prize .
It will be great to spend two weeks at Camp California .
First of all , I would like to say that the only month available from me to travel is July .
I finish my classes on the 25th of June and August is for going with my parents to France .
This has been scheduled 3 months ago .
About accommodation , I would prefer the log cabins because I think they are more cleaner than the tents .
While I 'm stayin there I would like to practise tennis and basketball , as I have been playing both sports all my life , and I have to say that I am very good at both .
There is one question I would like to ask you about the Camp .
I would like to know if there are any washing machines or a place to wash our clothes .
I hope this letter contains all the information you need from me .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely
From my point of view , the real question is : Who said that is enjoyable ?
Maybe for women , but not for me .
I know that this sounds horrible , but sometimes it 's what really happens .
For men , sometimes is hard to go shopping with their partners .
Sometimes that means a complete tour around all the fashion shops in town .
And of course , we are not allowed to stop in a place that we like .
The Sports Shop .
You can not lose the time because all the other shops could be closed when you arrive .
And that is allways what we want .
That 's men 's intention .
Another point is to go a big area .
Specially week - ends .
Everyone pushing a trolley and crashing around .
People should have to take a license to drive those things .
Someone could be injured .
And of course , the time to pay .
A huge que that lasts half an hour or more and finishes with you completely freaked out .
In conclusion , for me to go shopping is not enjoyable at all .
Dear Sir ,
I 'm writing to you inform you about the dissapointing evening I had when I went to your theather to see the play called " OVER THE RAINBOW " .
According to the advertisement you gave , there have been some important differents .
Firstly , the play started almost an hour late , and I went there to see Danny Brook , but there was a different actor on stage .
Secondly , in the advertisement the discounts are available but in the tickets I bought they were no discount .
Furthermore , I had planned to have a great dinner with my family in your restaurant and it was closed because the people who work in were on holidays .
In addition to this , I have to tell you that it was the most horrible evening I had out and because of this I want to ask you if you could send me a refound of a part of the money I wasted there .
I would be grateful if you do it .
Finally , I want to tell you that it is not useful for you and your theather to cheat to your customers . If you do it , there will be no bussiness for you and no satisfaction for them .
I look fordwad to hearing from you
Your sincerely ,
How has modern technology change my daily life ?
Nowadays , technology is the most useful tool that human beings have .
It affects everyone who live in this planet and every activity made in it .
In this case we are going to focus on me .
Emilio Almodar , 18 years old , University Student , and the career I have choosen is Internacional Commerce or Market .
I use technology every moment but I did not realise .
For example , when I come back home from university and I call my friends , I am using it because at home we have very modern phones and fax and almost everybody in my family has a cellular phone and thing like that .
We also have five computer , the latest versions of them , because they are useful for my father to work and for me to do some special works for University .
This machines are connected to Internet , and it gives to my family too much facility to get every information we want , from how to prepare son drink to what was the result of the Sunday 's football match .
In addition to this we use the net to comunicate with some friends we have in U.S.A. It 's really amazing .
Apart from this , I do n't spent my free time in technology .
I prefer playing rugby and going out with friends , because technology is not all life , but it is only a little part of it .
Dear Sir / Madam :
I am writing to ask about your advertisement and theatre show .
I am a student in Liverpool , and recently I had a week 's holiday in London .
First day in London , I saw your advertisement which was very interesting to me .
But I was really disappointed it .
First of all , there was only one actor that was different from your advertisement .
Also , it was certain to me to bought a discount tickets cause I am a student .
But , it was not availiable .
Second , I went to the theatre exactly seven thirty in the evening .
However the show started 45 minutes later .
I wasted time too much for waiting .
It was not good to me , cause I had only one week holiday in London .
Moreover the theatre restaurant was closed with the word " Stuff vacation " on the front door after the show .
It was absolutely different from your leaflet .
On the whole , I was really disappointed at that time .
Could you do me my half of money back .
I enclose my phone number and address .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours faithfully

Fashion of the Future .
Have you ever seen the film star wars ?
And did you notice something about fashion of the future ?
I think the people will wear convenient clothes with simple design in the future .
Because the people will stay at home more than now with their computer .
And they will use soft cozy cloths like cotton and silk .
However , if they have some special day when like important public day or special day of their life , they will wear very different kinds of clothes which was you never seen before .
Some of that will be very strange to our eyes , but some of others will be familiar to us .
And they will use the most kinds of things like small stone to diamond etc .
Maybe some peoples are nakid .
It will be very interesting ...
Just imagine the way of future people 's life .
And you can see the their clothes also .

Dear Mrs Ryan ,
Thank you very much for your letter .
I was really surprised and very happy when I read that I have won the first prize .
First of all because I have never been to California and second because it 's the first time I have ever won something .
The only time that is possible for me to travel is July , because I am working for a bank and this is the only month I can go on holiday .
For my stay in California I would prefer the accommodation in tents because this gives me a feeling of freedom and adventure and it is quite different to my live here in Greece .
The activities I would like mot to do are climbing and surfing .
In my free time I have climbed a lot of mountains in the surrounding area so I can say , that I am quite good in climbing .
But I have never ' surfed ' in my live , so that is an activity I have to learn .
Last but not least there are some things I would like to know : What kind of wheather do you have in California ?
Is it very hot ?
What kind of clothes should I bring with me ?
And what about money ?
How much money Should I take with me ?
Are there any activities which are not included ?
And my last question : how many persons are going to stay in each tent .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Many people , especially women , love shopping .
If you go to the centre of every big town you will see people walking from store to store searching for something to wear or to buy to eat .
But shopping is not always enjoyable .
First of all because of the big variety in the store .
Very often you do n't know what to buy because we do n't have only three or four different sport shoes to choose from , not , we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as Nike , adidas or Fila .
And very often you have to pay a lot of money for the product you want .
Another cause is that shops and stores are often overcrowded .
Very often you can hardly move because of the crowds of people .
And many people are in a hurry , so do n't wonder if other people have not tolerance and patience to wait and hit you with their shopping cars .
Of course there are a lot of other causes why shopping is n't always great fun , but the last cause , which is very important for me is that shopping is becoming more and more impersonal .
That means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores , where noone has time for you to show you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for me , no one to talk to and noone to complaine .
That is the most important reason why I only like to go shopping in little stores , where I have peace and quiet and very often nothing to complaine about .
Dear Mrs Helen Ryan ,
I was writting as reply of your letter , I am glad to have won the first prize in your competition for two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
About the information that you need , I must tell you that I will be able to travel only in July becase I got a new job and I ca n't ask for more than one month holidays each year and on the other months I will be very busy becase my workmates will take holidays on these months .
With the accomodation , I would prefered tents becase it is more according with a camp .
And with the activities I must chose Photography and Painting becase I am not very good for sports and I think I am doing well in these things .
Finally I just ask you What kind of clothes do I have to bring with me , and around How much money do you think I will need .
Thank you very much for everything .
Your Sincerely

Dear Kim ,
Here I am , writting you to tell everything about my wonderful experience at the concert .
You ca n't imagine How much did I enjoy that journey .
I started early in the morning helping to carry the stuff from the trucks to the place where the band played , I help with the music stuff like speakers , mics , lights , sound , etc .
And later the band arrived and played two or three times before the concert started .
And I was helping them fixing the last details .
When the concert started I was preparing some drinks for the band because when the concert finished they were very tired and tersty .
After the concert I only help with tidy up the place and made sure that everything was under control and clean .
Later the band was talking to me , I could get their new album free , and some other souvenirs from the band .
But the thing that particulary liked me was that I could do all kind of things just in one day and I could feel different emotions .
So , that 's everything that I can tell you , I enjoy a lot and I hope to have another experience like this .
Thank you for the letter you have sent recently .
It was a surprise to know that I won the first prize .
The reasons I am really writing , However , is to give you some details of my trip to California .
I 'll be taking an English Examination at the end of June and I think it would be a good idea if I can travel in July because it 's the only month I can spend abroad this year .
In the letter you said that accommodation provided can be either tents or log cabins .
I would prefer to stay in tents so that I will have the chance to be in contact with the nature as well as the scenery around .
Another thing I would like to choose from the activity list is singing ( because I take part in a chorus at school ) and photography .
I 'm really good taking pictures , it 's a way I have to express my feelings .
I wonder if you could send me more information about what kind of clothes have we bring .
Do you think you could also let me know how much money we will need during our stay at the Camp .
I would be grateful if you could send me a brochure and a map showing where the camp is .
thanking you in anticipation .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
What a surprise it was to get letter from you after all this time .
Sorry I haven't written for so long but I was really busy trying to apply for a job .
This is just to let you know with whom I worked .
In order to celebrate the 125 aniversary of the city , the Coun Council organised an open air concert .
It was a summer night and all the citizens , as well as tourists , had the opportunity to attend .
The pop band " Five " arrived into town and needed people to help with not only the organisation but also the stages and sound .
I knew some help was needed so I decided to speak to the manager .
I could n't believe when he said : " O.K. if you want to help , here is a list of what you can do . "
My job was to leave some leaflets on shops , restaurants and streets .
Working with this band was an experience I will never forget .
What I really enjoyed was been part of the staff .
Although I was too nervious , I knew I could do the job well .
I 'd love to hear all your news , why do n't you come and visit me ?
Perhaps I could show you the pictures I took .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Love from ,
Dear Mr or Madam ,
I am writing to express my dissapointment about the play " over the rainbow " which is performing at Circle Theatre .
First of all , the advertisement for the show announced Mr. Danny Brook as the principal actor .
Surprisingly , he never appeared on the stage , during the play .
Therefore , the theatre or the company is lying .
Secondly , the show started one hour fifteen past after .
We arrived at the theatre in time and we had to wait all that time until the show began .
Finally , when I asked about the discounts , an agressive employee refused to answer me .
He stayed looking at me and laughing .
It was incredible .
The evening was a horrible surprise , completely different from the promise written in the advertisement .
Defineteley , I want my money back as soon as possible .
I am looking forward to hearing from you
Yours faithfully
" Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
" I knew that but I would prefer to trust her so I told everything about Lynne Harter , our new collegue at school .
However , I have to admit that I told her my own opinion .
Well , it was the beginning of my tragedy .
So , I told Pat that Lynne was ugly , fat like a cow , and extremely agressive .
But I could n't shut my mouth , I continued : " You ca n't believe it Pat , she wears trousers like men and green flowery blouses " Of course , my friend and I were laughing during half an hour .
Two days after , when Pat came back to my school and she met Mr Harter , our head teacher , she told everything about Ann1 .
In that precisely moment I realized that I had forgotten to tell her that Ann was Mr Harter 's niece .
I know it 's my fault .
But , well , unhappiness started with Pat and my reveilled secrets .
Dear Sir ,
I 'm writing to complain for the musical show " Over the Rainbow " .
I 've been recently seeing in your theatre during my week 's holiday in London I must say I had a very disappointing evening ! I was sure this was the London 's newest and best musical show I had ever seen because of the good publicity you made in your advertisement , but I thought completely wrong !
Firstly , the play started nearly an hour later as I expected !
If the spectacle has been beautiful , I would have been quite pleased to wait .
Then , I had read that there would have been discounts available , but it was n't true !
So it 's better not to write anything if you do n't make it true then .
Finally , I hoped that , after these incidents , I would enjoy myself , but there was another change of programme : starring !
The main actor , Danny Brook , was changed and the one who played his part was n't as good as I expected .
Finished the show , I went to your theatre restaurant , but it was closed and this hasn't been said before .
Moreover , I was shocked by the reason for which it was closed : the chef went away after he received a phone call !
For all these reason , I want to ask for my money back and I hope to hear from you soon !
A suggestion ?
Organize better your shows and do not exagerate with publicity !
Yours sincerely ,
There would be many things to say about .
Technology is a wide field which increases very quickly .
It 's creating an artificial world , where everything is electronic and fast .
I 'm not sure if I must say technology has changed our life in positive or not .
Certainly , thanks to it , we can do things today that were impossible a few centuries ago .
Nowadays , we make a phone call with an astonish rapidity , instead at my grandparents ' time it took one month or more to have contact with people abroad , because the only means of communication was the post and its service was very slow !
When appeared the first car , it was already a great success .
Before that , people travelled by horse or worse .
Fortunately today everyone can take an aeroplane and go to America , Australia or wherever else he wants !
What can I say about the television ?
It allows us to keep connections with the other states of the world , improves our knowledge , offers us news , advises us about events which happened or will happen .
In the not very far 1914 , parent sent their sons in war and it was very difficult to know if they were still alive or dead !
It 's terrible !
Despite this , I 'm convinced all this progress caused some damages at the community , not only phisically .
We pay less attention to our life , to those things which give us happiness , that are n't money , success , power .
We became passive people , we follow the same routine every day and we live in a society where rules are strongly fixed .
I think everyone should live his own life how he wants to live it and make him known for who he is , not for his money , but for his abilities , his good habits , his personality .
Finally , everyone should decrease his own life 's rythm .
Mr John Smythe ,
I 'm writing to tell you about the horrible evening I had on Friday .
I was very excited with the idea of going to the theatre , but it did n't work out as I thought it will .
First of all the starring actors were supposed to be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , Tina did act , but Danny Brook was replaced by an awful actor whose name I do n't recall .
Second of all , the play was suposed to start at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 .
I 'm not used to waste my time sitting on a chair waiting , I do have better things to do with it .
Another thing I want to complain about , is that your advertised that discounts were available , but there was n't any discount at all .
To finish my " marvelous " evening , I wanted to eat at your restaurant , but it was closed and no reason was given .
As I did n't have a " perfect evening out " , I think I have the right to ask for my money back .
I hope you understand .
Yours faithfully
Pat 's story
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Now you 've probably asking yourself what does it mean , well , now I 'm going to explain it to you .
Two years ago in this school , Pat and I used to be best friends .
We used to tell everything to each other .
I was having some family problems , so my marks were getting down and down .
Pat was worried , she did n't know what to do .
One day she looked me in the eyes with a sharp deep look , Never have I seen such a deep look : and asked me what was happening and I told her as I always used to .
That afternoon she visited me and told me a plan she had designed to make my marks rise .
It consisted in stealing the school list from the computer , in other words , hack the school software .
I thought it was a great idea , so I stole about ten tests we were planned to do .
Pat could n't stand the pressure of the " crime " so she told the school directors that I stole the tests .
I was punished , nearly expelt , but Pat did n't receive any punishment .
I never accused her of lying , and I you ask me why , I really do n't know .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing to you after visiting your theatre .
Frankly speaking , I was very disappointed after my visit .
I was displeased from the very beginning , because I expected to get a discount as I 'm a student .
According to your advertisment I could have one but in reality there were no discounts at all .
But nevertheless I decided to go to your show .
The show started t 20.15 instead of 19.30 .
I had to wait in overcrowded hall .
When finally the show had started I found out that Danny Brook was replaced by another actor .
One of the reasons for my visiting your show was Danny Brook 's participance .
So , you could understand how disappointed I was .
To make matters worse the restaurant which was mentioned in your advertisment was closed .
So I had n't such perfect evening , as was promised in your advertisment .
In fact there were a lot of mistakes in your advertisment and I would be gratefull if you could give me back a part of my money .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
In my opinion , modern technologies play the important role in people 's life .
I think that at present the most important technologies are computer and Internet technologies .
Both computer and Internet influence people 's life .
I have to use computer every day .
It helps me in preparing my homeworks .
Firs of all Internet gives you an access to a great number of different information .
On the one hand Internet is often used for entertaiment , but on the other hand it 's also used in different business and education process !
With the help of Internet technologies I communicate with other people from all over the world it gives me chance to improve my English .
From my point of view , Internet can be used in education , because it gives an opportunity to have distant relations between pupils and teachers .
Though Internet has a lot of positive aspects I think you should be careful with it and not to be depended on it .

Dear Sir
At the begining I would like to thank You for Your letter - it pleased me much .
I have always dreamt about holidays ' in Camp California '
However there are some problems that I hope to solve .
First of all the only suitable time for me to go is July .
It is the only time when I am free from my duties - I am a doctor so you see that I can not let my patients down .
If we are talking about accomodation then accomodation in tents would be great - I love being close to the nature .
I would like You to know also about my two hobbys : swimming and surfing .
I am not telling about some kind of achivements in those discipines but It is my big pasion
I hope to have a chance to practice both of theme at ' Camp California ' .
There is also one thing that I would like to ask You about .
The question is : Do I need some extra money and what kind of clothes should I take for this trip ?
Yours sincerely
Anna Nowak
Unconected part of every people lifes is shopping .
We buy everything from clothes to food and the only thing that could stop us from this are money .
As a teenager I must addmit that there is nothing more enjoyable from shopping .
It 's like , , walking in the clouds , , you feel like flaing .
Choosing gave me such big pleasure because I never have to worry from vere do I take money for my wishes .
It all comes from my parents .
All I ought to do is buy and choose .
I think that , , having is a dream '' of all of us .
It 's hard for me even to emagine the situation when shopping is not enjoyable .
Probably it is one of the moments when you want something baddly and you ca n't have it .
Another situation is when you have to buy somebody a present .
Everybody know that , , present presents a problem '' You know your own task but what vith a task of the other person ?
However I ca n't agree with opinion that , , Shopping is not always enjoyable '' I think that everybody like to buy but not everybody like to see pleasure in it .
